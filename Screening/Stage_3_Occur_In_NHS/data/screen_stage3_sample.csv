J2258,2021,Non-Invasive Prenatal Fetal Blood Group Genotype and Its Application in the Management of Hemolytic Disease of Fetus and Newborn: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Hemolytic disease of fetus and newborn (HDFN) imposes great healthcare burden being associated with maternal alloimmunization against parental-inherited fetal red blood cell antigens causing fetal anemia or death. Noninvasive prenatal analysis (NIPT) provides safe fetal RHD genotyping for early identification of risk pregnancies and proper management guidance. We aimed to conduct systematic review and meta-analysis on NIPT's beneficial application, in conjunction with quantitative maternal alloantibody analysis, for early diagnosis of pregnancies at risk. Search for relevant articles was done in; PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Ovid (January 2006-April 2020), including only English-written articles reporting reference tests and accuracy data. Nineteen eligible studies were critically appraised. NIPT was estimated highly sensitive/specific for fetal RHD genotyping beyond 11-week gestation. Amplifications from >=2 exons are optimum to increase accuracy. NIPT permits cost-effectiveness, precious resources sparing, and low emotional stress. Knowledge of parental ethnicity is important for correct NIPT result interpretations and quantitative screening. Cut-off titer >=8-up-to-32 is relevant for anti-D alloantibodies, while, lower titer is for anti-K. Alloimmunization is influenced by maternal RHD status, gravida status, and history of adverse obstetrics. In conclusion, NIPT allows evidence-based provision of routine anti-D immunoprophylaxis and estimates potential fetal risks for guiding further interventions. Future large-scale studies investigating NIPT's non-RHD genotyping within different ethnic groups and in presence of clinically significant alloantibodies are needed. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc."
J3155,2022,Tocilizumab for giant cell arteritis,"- Background Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common form of systemic vasculitis in people older than 50 years of age. It causes granulomatous inflammation of medium‐ to large‐sized vessels. Tocilizumab is a recombinant monoclonal antibody directed against interleukin‐6 receptors (IL‐6R). Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of tocilizumab, given alone or with corticosteroids, compared with therapy without tocilizumab for treatment of GCA. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 3 January 2020. Selection criteria We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared tocilizumab of any dosage regimen (alone or with corticosteroids) with therapy without tocilizumab that had a minimum follow‐up of six months. Participants were at least 50 years of age, with biopsy‐proven GCA or by large‐vessel vasculitis by angiography, and met the American College of Rheumatology 1990 guidelines for GCA. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodology. Main results Main results We included two RCTs in the review. The studies were conducted in the USA, Canada, and Europe and enrolled a total of 281 participants with GCA, of whom 74% were women. The mean age of participants was 70 years, with new‐onset or relapsing GCA, and fulfilled the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria with no uncontrolled comorbidities. Both studies were funded by F. Hoffmann‐La Roche AG, the manufacturer of tocilizumab. Findings One RCT (30 participants) compared tocilizumab administered every four weeks versus placebo. Point estimates at 12 months and beyond favored tocilizumab over placebo in terms of sustained remission (risk ratio (RR) 4.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 14.88; moderate‐certainty evidence). Point estimates suggest no evidence of a difference for all‐cause mortality at 12 months or more (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.94; moderate‐certainty evidence). At 12 months, mean time to first relapse after induction of remission was 25 weeks in favor of participants receiving tocilizumab compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) 25, 95% CI 11.4 to 38.6; moderate‐certainty evidence). The second RCT (250 participants) randomized participants into two intervention and two comparator groups to receive tocilizumab weekly (100 participants), bi‐weekly (49 participants), weekly placebo + 26‐week taper (50 participants), or weekly placebo + 52‐week taper (51 participants). At 12 months, point estimates from this study on proportion of participants with sustained remission favored participants who received tocilizumab weekly versus placebo + 52‐week taper (RR 3.17, 95% CI 1.71 to 5.89; 151 participants); tocilizumab weekly versus placebo + 26‐week taper (RR 4.00, 95% CI 1.97 to 8.12; 150 participants); tocilizumab every other week versus placebo + 52‐week taper (RR 3.01, 95% CI 1.57 to 5.75; 100 participants); tocilizumab every other week versus placebo + 26‐week taper (RR 3.79, 95% CI 1.82 to 7.91; 99 participants) (moderate‐certainty evidence). Point estimates on proportion of participants who did not need escape therapy (defined by the study as the inability to keep to the protocol‐defined prednisone taper) favored participants who received tocilizumab weekly versus placebo + 52‐week taper (RR 1.71, 95% CI 1.24 to 2.35; 151 participants); tocilizumab weekly versus placebo + 26‐week taper (RR 2.96, 95% CI 1.83 to 4.78; 150 participants); tocilizumab every other week versus placebo + 52‐week taper (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.14; 100 participants) but not tocilizumab eve y other week versus placebo + 26‐week taper (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.54; 99 participants) (moderate‐certainty evidence). This study did not report mean time to first relapse after induction of remission or all‐cause mortality. Across comparison groups, the same study found no evidence of a difference in vision changes and inconsistent evidence with regard to quality of life. Evidence on quality of life as assessed by the physical (MD 8.17, 95% CI 4.44 to 11.90) and mental (MD 5.61, 95% CI 0.06 to 11.16) component score of the 36‐Item Short Form Health Survey (SF‐36) favored weekly tocilizumab versus placebo + 52‐week taper but not bi‐weekly tocillizumab versus placebo + 26‐week taper (moderate‐certainty evidence). Adverse events One RCT reported a lower percentage of participants who experienced serious adverse events when receiving tocilizumab every four weeks versus placebo. The second RCT reported no evidence of a difference among groups with regard to adverse events; however, fewer participants reported serious adverse events in the tocilizumab weekly and tocilizumab biweekly interventions compared with the placebo + 26‐week taper and placebo + 52‐week taper comparators. Investigators in both studies reported that infection was the most frequently reported adverse event. Authors' conclusions This review indicates that tocilizumab therapy may be beneficial in terms of proportion of participants with sustained remission, relapse‐free survival, and the need for escape therapy. While the evidence was of moderate certainty, only two studies were included in the review, suggesting that further research is required to corroborate these findings. Future trials should address issues related to the required duration of therapy, patient‐reported outcomes such as quality of life and economic outcomes, as well as the clinical outcomes evaluated in this review. Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of tocilizumab (a medicine that reduces inflammation) for treating giant cell arteritis (a disease of the blood vessels)? Key messages  · People with giant cell arteritis who have an injection of tocilizumab every week or two weeks have an improved chance of being symptom‐free after a year. People treated with tocilizumab every four weeks probably have an improved chance of being symptom‐free after a year. · Tocilizumab probably causes similar numbers of adverse (unwanted) effects to a placebo (dummy treatment). · More studies are needed to strengthen the body of evidence and investigate whether duration of treatment affects the success of tocilizumab. What is giant cell arteritis?  Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an inflammation (swelling) of the vessels that carry blood from the heart to the rest of the body (arteries). It usually affects people aged over 50 and can cause: · vision problems (such as double vision or vision loss in one or both eye(s)); · jaw pain while eating or talking; · pain and tenderness over the temples (sides of the head); · frequent and severe headaches; and · weight loss. If untreated, GCA can cause permanent loss of vision or a stroke. How is GCA treated?  GCA is usually treated with anti‐inflammation medicines called steroids. People typically need to take steroids for several years, which can cause adverse effects such as diabetes, osteoporosis (bone loss), hypertension (raised blood pressure), and infection. A possible alternative treatment is an injectable medicine called tocilizumab, which aims to stop the body’s defense system (immune system) from mistakenly attacking its healthy tissues and causing inflammation. What did we want to find out?  We wanted to compare the benefits and risks of tocilizumab against those of other treatments for GCA. What did we do?  We searched for studies that compared tocilizumab against other treatments for GCA. We compared and summarized the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes of participant groups. What did we find?  We ound two studies, conducted in the USA, Canada, and Europe, involving a total of 281 people with GCA. Everyone taking part in the study was aged over 50 (average age: 70), and 74% were women. Tocilizumab was given every four weeks in one study (30 people) and every week or every two weeks in the other study (251 people). Both studies lasted one year, and compared tocilizumab against a placebo. Both studies were funded by the manufacturer of tocilizumab. Tocilizumab given every four weeks compared to placebo The evidence suggests that after a year of treatment, compared to placebo, tocilizumab given every four weeks probably: · improves the chances of successful GCA treatment (absence of symptoms); · delays the return of GCA; and · reduces the need to use steroids to treat GCA. Tocilizumab given every one or two weeks compared to placebo Tocilizumab given either every week or every two weeks for a year: · improves the chances of successful GCA treatment; · probably improves the chances of not needing escape therapy; · probably improves physical and mental quality of life (well‐being); but · probably makes little or no difference to changes in vision. Adverse effects The most common adverse effect experienced by people taking part in the study was infection. The evidence suggests that tocilizumab probably decreases the number of serious adverse effects compared to placebo. What are the limitations of the evidence?  The evidence is only based on two studies, which limits our confidence in the findings. How up‐to‐date is the evidence?  The evidence is current to January 2020."
J4033,2023,Ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for premature termination codon class I mutations) for cystic fibrosis,"- Background Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common, life‐shortening, genetic disorder in populations of Northern European descent caused by the mutation of a single gene that codes for the production of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. This protein coordinates the transport of salt (and bicarbonate) across cell surfaces, and the mutation most notably affects the airways. In the lungs of people with CF, the defective protein compromises mucociliary clearance and makes the airway prone to chronic infection and inflammation, damaging the structure of the airways and eventually leading to respiratory failure. In addition, abnormalities in the truncated CFTR protein lead to other systemic complications, including malnutrition, diabetes and subfertility. Five classes of mutation have been described, depending on the impact of the mutation on the processing of the CFTR protein in the cell. In class I mutations, premature termination codons prevent the production of any functional protein, resulting in severe CF. Therapies targeting class I mutations aim to enable the normal cellular mechanism to read through the mutation, potentially restoring the production of the CFTR protein. This could, in turn, normalise salt transport in the cells and decrease the chronic infection and inflammation that characterises lung disease in people with CF. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of ataluren and similar compounds on clinically important outcomes in people with CF with class I mutations (premature termination codons). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles. The last search of the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register was conducted on 7 March 2022. We searched clinical trial registries maintained by the European Medicines Agency, the US National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization. The last search of the clinical trials registries was conducted on 4 October 2022. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of parallel design comparing ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for class I mutations) with placebo in people with CF who have at least one class I mutation. Data collection and analysis For the included trials, the review authors independently extracted data, assessed the risk of bias and evaluated the certainty of the evidence using GRADE; trial authors were contacted for additional data. Main results Our searches identified 56 references to 20 trials; of these, 18 trials were excluded. Both the included parallel RCTs compared ataluren to placebo for 48 weeks in 517 participants (males and females; age range six to 53 years) with CF who had at least one nonsense mutation (a type of class I mutation). The certainty of evidence and risk of bias assessments for the trials were moderate overall. Random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding of trial personnel were well documented; participant blinding was less clear. Some participant data were excluded from the analysis in one trial that also had a high risk of bias for selective outcome reporting. PTC Therapeutics Incorporated sponsored both trials with grant support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Orphan Products Development and the National Institutes of Health. The trials reported no difference between treatment groups in terms of quality of life, and no improvement in respiratory function measures. Ataluren was associated with a higher rate of episodes of renal impairment (risk ratio 12.81, 95% confidence interval 2.46 to 66.65; P = 0.002; I 2 = 0%; 2 trials, 517 participants). The trials reported no treatment effect for ataluren for the review's secondary outcomes of pulmonary exacerbation, computed tomography score, weight, body mass index and swea chloride. No deaths were reported in the trials. The earlier trial performed a post hoc subgroup analysis of participants not receiving concomitant chronic inhaled tobramycin (n = 146). This analysis demonstrated favourable results for ataluren (n = 72) for the relative change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) per cent (%) predicted and pulmonary exacerbation rate. The later trial aimed to prospectively assess the efficacy of ataluren in participants not concomitantly receiving inhaled aminoglycosides, and found no difference between ataluren and placebo in FEV 1 % predicted and pulmonary exacerbation rate. Authors' conclusions There is currently insufficient evidence to determine the effect of ataluren as a therapy for people with CF with class I mutations. One trial reported favourable results for ataluren in a post hoc subgroup analysis of participants not receiving chronic inhaled aminoglycosides, but these were not reproduced in the later trial, suggesting that the earlier results may have occurred by chance. Future trials should carefully assess for adverse events, notably renal impairment, and consider the possibility of drug interactions. Cross‐over trials should be avoided, given the potential for the treatment to change the natural history of CF. Plain language summary Ataluren and similar compounds (specific therapies for premature termination codon class I mutations) for cystic fibrosis Review question Can ataluren (and similar compounds specifically targeting class I mutations in cystic fibrosis (CF)) improve the quality of life and lung function of people with CF without having adverse effects? Key messages What is CF? In people with CF, the gene encoding a protein called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is faulty. This especially affects the airways, causing the airway surface to dry out and making it difficult to clear thick mucus. This leads to progressive infection and damages the lungs, shortening life expectancy. How will ataluren treat CF? In people with certain CF genetic mutations where the genetic instructions for producing the CFTR protein are interrupted (known as premature termination codon or class I mutations), ataluren (and similar medicines) may be able to skip over the break in the faulty gene sequence and allow the body to produce a corrected version of the CFTR protein. By correcting the protein, the airway surface should remain hydrated, allowing people with CF to better clear their mucus and so develop fewer lung infections. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether ataluren can improve the quality of life and lung function of people with CF, and whether it can do so without any side effects. We also wanted to measure the effects on lung infections (need for hospital visits or additional antibiotics), survival, nutritional status (weight, body mass index and height) and whether treatment was cost‐effective. What did we do? We searched for trials that directly compared drugs such as ataluren to placebo (treatment not containing an active drug) or to a different treatment for these specific genetic mutations in any people with CF. What did we find? We found two trials including 517 people (males and females between 6 and 53 years of age) comparing ataluren to a placebo. The trials lasted 48 weeks and everyone taking part in the trials had at least one gene with a class I mutation. Key results In people taking ataluren, there was no improvement in clinical outcomes such as quality of life, lung function, exacerbations (flare up of disease), sweat chloride (salt) levels or weight compared with people taking placebo. The trials found that kidney damage was more common in people taking ataluren. The earlier trial analysed their results in a way not originally planned to see whether the effects of ataluren and placebo were different in people using inhaled tobramycin (an antibiotic) on a long‐term basis compared with people not taking the inhaled antibiotic. In people taking ataluren but not using inhaled tobramycin, lung function declined at a slower rate and there were fewer exacerbations than in people in the placebo group also not using inhaled tobramycin. The later trial specifically recruited people not taking tobramycin to see whether this really was an effect of the antibiotic, but the investigators did not find any difference between the ataluren and placebo groups for changes in lung function or exacerbations. This suggests that the earlier results occurred by chance. There were no deaths and we did not find any differences between ataluren and placebo in side effects or nutritional status. Neither trial reported on hospitalisations, extra courses of antibiotics or cost‐effectiveness. We have not found enough high‐quality evidence to determine the effect of ataluren for treating CF. We recommend that future trials are designed and reported clearly so that their results can be included in a systematic review. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in our findings, but there is some uncertainty due to how widely the results varied between participants. We are satisfied that everyone taking part had an equal chance of being in either group (ataluren or placebo) and that no one could work out which group the next person would be put into (so that healthier people did not receive the treatment and make the results seem better). We believe that the clinicians running the trials and those taking part in the trials did not know which treatment each person was receiving. We have some concerns about the emphasis the investigators of one trial placed on the results of a comparison they had not planned (the use of long‐term inhaled tobramycin). Unfortunately, that trial did not report all its results clearly. Sometimes, the results were reported in a way that meant they could not be used in this review, and sometimes the information was not reported at all. This affected our confidence in the overall results. Trial funding sources Both trials were sponsored by PTC Therapeutics Incorporated, who make ataluren. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the US Food and Drug Administration's Office of Orphan Products Development and the US National Institutes of Health also supported the trials. How up to date is this evidence? We last searched for evidence on 4 October 2022."
J3232,2022,Cost-Effectiveness of Open-Group Behavioral Weight Management Programs: RCT With 5 Year Outcomes,"Background: Open-group behavioral weight management programs are effective in the short term but longer term outcomes are unclear. We conducted the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the 5-year effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a commercial opengroup intervention versus standard care. Method(s): We randomized 1267 adults from English primary care practices with BMI>=28kg/m<sup>2</sup> to either a brief intervention, 12-week behavioral program, or 52-week behavioral program in a 2:5:5 allocation. We followed them up 5 years later. We estimated adjusted differences in 5-year weight change between randomized groups using ANCOVA, assessed within-trial cost-effectiveness, and modeled long-term cost-effectiveness. This study is registered: ISRCTN64986150. Result(s): We ascertained weight for 871 (69%) participants. Mean (SD) weight change from baseline to 5 years was -0.46kg (8.31) in the brief intervention group, -1.95kg (9.55) in the 12-week program group, and -2.67kg (9.81) in the 52-week program. The adjusted difference (95%CI) was -1.76kg (-3.68, 0.17) between the 52-week program and the brief intervention; -0.96 kg (-2.90, 0.97) between the 12-week program and the brief intervention; and -0.80kg (-2.13, 0.54) between the 52-week and the 12-week program. There was no evidence of any differences between groups in fat mass, glycated hemoglobin, lipid profile and blood pressure. During the study, the 12-week program incurred the lowest cost and produced the highest Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY). Modeling of clinical events beyond 5 years, suggested the 52-week program would deliver the highest QALYs at the lowest cost. Conclusion(s): Whilst 5-year differences in weight were not conclusive, they counter the common belief that all weight lost is quickly regained. Although there was no evidence within the trial that cardiovascular risk factors improved, long-term modeling suggests that commercial open-group behavioral programs are likely to reduce the incidence of weight-related disease and may be cost-saving."
J5341,2024,"Real-World Evaluation of the Feasibility, Acceptability and Safety of a Remote, Self-Management Parkinson's Disease Care Pathway: A Healthcare Improvement Initiative","Background: There is significant unmet need for effective and efficiently delivered care for people with Parkinson's disease (PwP). We undertook a service improvement initiative to co-develop and implement a new care pathway, Home Based Care (HBC), based on supported self-management, remote monitoring and the ability to trigger a healthcare contact when needed. Objective(s): To evaluate feasibility, acceptability and safety of Home Based Care. Method(s): We evaluated data from the first 100 patients on HBC for 6 months. Patient monitoring, performed at baseline and 6-monthly, comprised motor (MDS-UPDRS II and accelerometer), non-motor (NMSQ, PDSS-2, HADS) and quality of life (PDQ) measures. Care quality was audited against Parkinson's UK national audit standards. Process measures captured feasibility. Acceptability was assessed using a mixed-methods approach comprising questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. Result(s): Between October 2019 and January 2021, 108 PwP were enrolled onto HBC, with data from 100 being available at 6 months. Over 90% of all questionnaires were returned, 97% were complete or had < 3 missing items. Reporting and communications occurred within agreed timeframes. Compared with baseline, after 6m on HBC, PD symptoms were stable; more PwP felt listened to (90% vs. 79%) and able to seek help (79% vs. 68%). HBC met 93% of national audit criteria. Key themes from the interviews included autonomy and empowerment. Conclusion(s): We have demonstrated acceptability, feasibility and safety of our novel remotely delivered Parkinson's care pathway. Ensuring scalability will widen its reach and realize its benefits for underserved communities, enabling formal comparisons with standard care and cost-effectiveness evaluation.

J859,2019,Lower carbohydrate diets in type 2 diabetes/pre-diabetes and metabolic improvements in a UK primary care service,"Background and aims: Diabetes is a common metabolic disease which poses a massive health and financial burden, with a total spend on diabetes prescribing of 316 per patient in 2017/18 (UK) according to Public Health England's Diabetes Outcomes Versus Expenditure (DOVE) Tool. We present data from a retrospective analysis of a low-carbohydrate diet intervention conducted in Type 2 diabetic (T2DM) and pre-diabetic patients, in a primary care service in the North West of England. Material(s) and Method(s): The intervention involved patient-based goal setting and explanations of the glycaemic consequences of sugary and starchy carbohydrates, incorporated into 10-minute primary care consultations and group work. Standard metabolic outcomes in diabetic and pre-diabetic patients, before and after the dietary modification, were analysed. The patients included 122 diabetics (80 men, 42 women) and 67 Pre-diabetics (35 men, 32 women). The metabolic parameters were measured using standard procedures and included body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), HbA1C, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, Total Cholesterol, Serum Triglycerides, Serum High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and Triglyceride/HDL ratio. Descriptive statistics were calculated and presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Median (IQR) duration of the intervention was 20 months (7,31) for the diabetic and 19 (9, 30) months for the prediabetic patients. Result(s):We observed improvements in all the aforementioned metabolic parameters for diabetic and pre-diabetic patients. Table 1 shows metabolic outcomes at baseline and their change after the intervention presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). The greatest reduction was observed for weight (pre-diabetics: 6.7 kg (4.5, 10.9) and diabetics: 7 kg (4.5, 12)) and HbA1C (pre-diabetics: 5.0 mmol/mol (3, 6) and diabetics: 16 mmol/mol (9, 31)). Conclusion(s): This study emphasises early prevention through nonpharmacological approaches in the management of T2DM/Pre-Diabetes focusing on a simple, adaptable and scalable lower-carbohydrate dietary intervention in the primary care setting. Our results demonstrate an improvement in all typically measured cardio-metabolic factors with the greatest benefits to weight and HbA1C. Given its low cost, this intervention has potential implications on healthcare cost savings if trialled for potential implementation at scale."
J5368,2024,Standard‐ versus extended‐duration anticoagulation for primary venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients,"- Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes two interrelated conditions, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Risk factors include dehydration, prolonged immobilization, acute medical illness, trauma, clotting disorders, previous thrombosis, varicose veins with superficial vein thrombosis, exogenous hormones, malignancy, chemotherapy, infection, inflammation, pregnancy, obesity, smoking, and advancing age. It is estimated that hospitalized patients are 100 times more likely to develop VTE and, compared with surgical patients, medical patients often have more severe forms of VTE. VTE carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic strategies, including mechanical and pharmacological methods, are recommended for patients at risk of VTE. Pharmacological prophylaxis is considered the standard practice for acutely ill medical patients at risk of developing VTE in the absence of contraindications. For hospitalized patients, the risk of VTE extends beyond hospital stay and up to 90 days, with most events occurring within 45 days of discharge. Despite that, it remains unclear whether extended‐duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis would provide benefits without added risks or harm. Objectives To assess the benefits and risks of standard‐ versus extended‐duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science databases, as well as the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers up to 27 March 2023. We also searched reference lists of all included studies for additional references and searched the last five years of the American Society of Hematology conference proceedings. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing standard‐duration versus extended‐duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients (adults being treated in a medical inpatient setting). Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures set by Cochrane. At least two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion and performed data extraction. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We analyzed outcomes data using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (during the treatment period and within 45 days of hospitalization) and long term (assessed beyond 45 days of hospitalization). Primary outcomes were symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and all‐cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were total VTE, a composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events (including myocardial infarction, non‐fatal PE, cardiopulmonary death, stroke), fatal bleeding, and VTE‐related mortality. Main results A total of seven RCTs fulfilled our inclusion criteria, comprising 40,846 participants. All studies contributing data to our outcomes were at low risk of bias in all domains. Most studies reported the outcomes in the short term. Extended‐duration anticoagulation, compared with standard‐duration anticoagulation, for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients reduced the risk of short‐term symptomatic VTE (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78; standard‐duration 12 per 1000, extended‐duration 7 per 1000, 95% CI 6 to 10; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome [NNTB] 204, 95% CI 136 to 409; 4 studies, 24,773 participants; high‐certainty evidence). This benefit, however, was offset by an increased risk of short‐term major bleeding (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.79; standard‐duration 3 per 1000, extended duration 6 per 1000, 95% CI 5 to 8; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome [NNTH 314, 95% CI 538 to 222; 7 studies, 40,374 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Extended‐duration anticoagulation, compared with standard‐duration, results in little to no difference in short‐term all‐cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.08; standard‐duration 34 per 1000, extended‐duration 33 per 1000, 95% CI 30 to 37; 5 studies, 38,080 participants; high‐certainty evidence), reduced short‐term total VTE (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85; standard‐duration 37 per 1000, extended duration 28 per 1000, 95% CI 25 to 32; NNTB 107, 95% CI 76 to 178; 5 studies, 33,819 participants; high‐certainty evidence), and short‐term composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.91; standard‐duration 41 per 1000, extended‐duration 29 per 1000, 95% CI 23 to 37; NNTB 85, 95% CI 50 to 288; 1 study, 7513 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Extended‐duration anticoagulation may result in little to no difference in short‐term fatal bleeding (RR 2.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 6.22; standard‐duration 0 per 1000, extended‐duration 0 per 1000, 95% CI 0 to 1; 7 studies, 40,374 participants; low‐certainty evidence), and likely results in little to no difference in short‐term VTE‐related mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.05; standard‐duration 5 per 1000, extended‐duration 4 per 1000 95% CI 3 to 6; 6 studies, 36,170 participants; moderate‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions In the short term, extended‐ versus standard‐duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients reduced the risk of symptomatic VTE at the expense of an increased risk of major bleeding. Extended‐duration anticoagulation resulted in little to no difference in all‐cause mortality. Extended‐duration anticoagulation reduced the risk of total VTE and the composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events, but may show little to no difference in fatal bleeding and VTE‐related mortality. Further data, with longer follow‐up, are needed to determine the optimal agent and duration for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients. Plain language summary Does a strategy of extended‐duration blood thinners for preventing the development of blood clots in the legs and lungs improve the outcomes of patients admitted to the hospital for an acute medical illness? Key message Extending blood thinners beyond the hospital stay (after discharge) decreased the probability of developing blood thrombi (blood clots) in the legs and emboli (blood clots) in the lungs at the expense of an increased risk of major bleeding. What is venous thromboembolism (VTE)? Venous thrombosis is when a blood thrombus (blood clot) is formed in a vein. This can cause symptoms such as pain and swelling due to obstruction of the blood flow. It most commonly occurs in the deep veins of the legs, commonly referred to as deep venous thrombosis (DVT). In some instances, the blood thrombi can dislodge, forming an embolus (blood clot that has migrated) that travels through the venous system to another part of the body, most commonly the lungs. This condition is called pulmonary embolism (PE), which can sometimes be fatal. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a term used to describe both DVT and PE. Hospitalization due to medical illness is amongst the predisposing factors for VTE. This is likely due to a variety of risk factors, including underlying medical problems, new illness, decreased mobility and possibly medications, which is why prevention is crucial in these patient populations. How is VTE prevented in acutely ill hospitalized patients? Patients who are hospitalized due to medical illness and who are at high risk of developing VTE can undergo prevention strategies. Unless there is a reason not to do so, patients usually receive blood thinners to decrease the risk of VTE. Usually, blood thinners are administered throughout hospitalization. It has been proposed that extending blood thinners after hospital discharge might have beneficial effects and could better prevent VTE. What did e want to find out? We wanted to find out whether extending the administration of blood thinners beyond the hospital stay would lower the risk of developing VTE and its associated dangers compared to its administration only during the hospital stay. We also sought to explore the unwanted effects related to extending the duration of blood thinners. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated extending blood thinners beyond the hospital stay in acutely ill medical patients and compared them to blood thinners only during hospitalization. We then summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as the respective study sizes and research methods. What did we find? Our search yielded seven clinical trials, including 40,846 participants that addressed our review question. Most studies reported the outcomes in the short term (i.e. during the treatment period and within 45 days of hospitalization). Extended‐duration blood thinners, compared with standard‐duration blood thinners, reduced the risk of short‐term symptomatic VTE (i.e. VTE that manifests because of patient‐reported symptoms). However, that benefit was counteracted by an increased risk of short‐term major bleeding (e.g. requiring blood transfusion and/or associated with a severe drop in haemoglobin). There was little to no difference between either strategy in terms of death from any cause. Extended‐duration blood thinners, compared with standard‐duration blood thinners, resulted in a reduction of short‐term total VTE (including those manifesting with and without symptoms, only discovered via routine testing/screening) and the composite outcome of fatal and irreversible vascular events (including non‐fatal heart attack, non‐fatal PE, death due to heart/lung causes, or stroke). However, there is likely little to no difference between either strategy in terms of fatal bleeding (significant bleeding resulting in death) or death due to VTE. What are the limitations of the evidence? When assessing for fatal bleeding and death related to VTE, the results from the studies varied widely. How up to date is this evidence? The evidence is up to date to March 2023."
J871,2019,Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis in people with low surgical risk,"- Background Severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The definitive management for severe AS is aortic valve replacement (AVR). The choice of transcatheter approach versus open‐heart surgery for AVR in people with severe AS and low surgical risk remains a matter of debate. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in people with severe AS and low surgical risk. Search methods We searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on 29 April 2019: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We searched all databases from inception to present and imposed no restriction on language or date of publication. Selection criteria We included RCTs that compared TAVI and SAVR in adults (18 years of age or older) with severe AS and low surgical risk. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias in the studies included. We analysed dichotomous data using the risk ratio (RR) and continuous data using the mean difference (MD), with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow‐up). Primary outcomes were all‐cause mortality, stroke, and rehospitalisation. Secondary outcomes were myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac death, length of hospital stay (LOS), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, new‐onset atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury (AKI), and any bleeding. Main results We identified four studies (13 reports), with 2818 participants, and one ongoing study. Overall certainty of evidence ranged from high to very low. There is probably little or no difference between TAVI and SAVR for the following short‐term outcomes: all‐cause mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.44; SAVR 11 deaths per 1000, TAVI 8 deaths per 1000 (95% CI 4 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); stroke (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25; SAVR 21 strokes per 1000, TAVI 16 strokes per 1000 (95% CI 9 to 27); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); MI (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.58; SAVR 14 MI per 1000, TAVI 11 MI per 1000 (95% CI 6 to 21); 2748 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence); and cardiac death (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.56; SAVR 10 cardiac deaths per 1000, TAVI 7 cardiac deaths per 1000 (95% CI 3 to 16); 2818 participants; 4 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). TAVI may reduce the risk of short‐term rehospitalisation, although the confidence interval also includes the possibility of no difference in risk between groups (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06; SAVR 30 cases per 1000, TAVI 19 cases per 1000 (95% CI 12 to 32); 2468 participants; 2 studies; low‐certainty evidence). TAVI, compared with SAVR, probably increases the risk of PPM implantation (RR 3.65, 95% CI 1.50 to 8.87; SAVR 47 per 1000, TAVI 170 cases per 1000 (95% CI 70 to 413); number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 7; 2683 participants; 3 studies; moderate‐certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the LOS in days, although it appears to be associated with shorter LOS. TAVI, compared with SAVR, reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.30; 2683 participants; 3 studies), AKI (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.58; 2753 participants; 4 studies), and bleeding (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62; 2753 participants; 4 studies) (all high‐certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Our meta‐analysis indicates that, in t e short term, TAVI probably has little or no mortality difference compared to SAVR for severe AS in individuals with low surgical risk. Similarly, there is probably little or no difference in risk of stroke, MI, and cardiac death between the two approaches. TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation, but we are uncertain about the effects on LOS. TAVI reduces the risk of atrial fibrillation, AKI, and bleeding. However, this benefit is offset by the increased risk of PPM implantation. Long‐term follow‐up data are needed to further assess and validate these outcomes, especially durability, in the low surgical risk population. Plain language summary Transcatheter aortic valve implantation versus surgical aortic valve replacement in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk Review question Does transcatheter approach, compared to open‐heart surgery, for aortic valve replacement improve outcomes in people with severe aortic stenosis and low surgical risk? Background Aortic stenosis (AS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins). It typically gets worse over time. Its severity can be divided into mild, moderate, severe, and very severe; and it is distinguishable by ultrasound scan of the heart and other clinical features. Once it has become severe, treatment primarily involves surgery to replace the valve. An alternative approach is to use transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). This approach improves outcomes in individuals who are inoperable or at a high to intermediate risk for surgery. However, it remains unclear if TAVI is beneficial to those who have severe AS and are at a low surgical risk. Search Date The evidence is current to April 2019. We searched the literature and found a total of 3092 citations that were potentially relevant. After reviewing each of these, we found 13 published articles describing four clinical trials that could help us answer our question. Study characteristics The four clinical trials included 2818 participants who were randomly allocated to undergo either TAVI or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The trials were multicentre and took place in Australia, Canada, France, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the USA, Denmark, and Sweden. Key Results Moderate‐certainty evidence from clinical trials shows that, in the short term (i.e. during hospitalisation and up to 30 days of follow‐up), there is probably little or no difference between TAVI compared with SAVR in risk of death due to any cause, stroke (insult to the brain), myocardial infarction (injury or death of heart muscle), or death due to cardiac causes (e.g. myocardial infarction or failure of the heart muscle pump). Low‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI may reduce the risk of rehospitalisation compared with SAVR. We are uncertain whether TAVI, compared with SAVR, affects the length of hospital stay, although it appears to be associated with shorter duration of hospitalisation. High‐certainty evidence shows that fewer people had atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heart rhythm), acute kidney injury (insult to the kidney), and bleeding when they underwent TAVI, compared with SAVR. However, moderate‐certainty evidence shows that TAVI probably increases the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (a device that is placed to artificially set the heart rhythm), compared with SAVR. Quality of the evidence We consider the overall quality of evidence to be moderate for most relevant outcomes (death, stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac death, and risk of permanent pacemaker implantation), with the exception of rehospitalisation (low‐quality evidence) and length of hospital stay (very low quality evidence). The evidence for atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and bleeding was of high quality."
J3578,2022,Antidepressants for hip and knee osteoarthritis,"- Background Although pain is common in osteoarthritis, most people fail to achieve adequate analgesia. Increasing acknowledgement of the contribution of pain sensitisation has resulted in the investigation of medications affecting pain processing with central effects. Antidepressants contribute to pain management in other conditions where pain sensitisation is present. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of antidepressants for the treatment of symptomatic knee and hip osteoarthritis in adults. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search was January 2021. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials of adults with osteoarthritis that compared use of antidepressants to placebo or alternative comparator. We included trials that focused on efficacy (pain and function), treatment‐related adverse effects and had documentation regarding discontinuation of participants. We excluded trials of less than six weeks of duration or had participants with concurrent mental health disorders. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Major outcomes were pain; responder rate; physical function; quality of life; and proportion of participants who withdrew due to adverse events, experienced any adverse events or had serious adverse events. Minor outcomes were proportion meeting the OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) Response Criteria, radiographic joint structure changes and proportion of participants who dropped out of the study for any reason. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Main results Nine trials (2122 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Seven trials examined only knee osteoarthritis. Two also included participants with hip osteoarthritis. All trials compared antidepressants to placebo, with or without non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs. Trial sizes were 36 to 388 participants. Most participants were female, with mean ages of 54.5 to 65.9 years. Trial durations were 8 to 16 weeks. Six trials examined duloxetine. We combined data from nine trials in meta‐analyses for knee and hip osteoarthritis. One trial was at low risk of bias in all domains. Five trials were at risk of attrition and reporting bias. High‐certainty evidence found that antidepressants resulted in a clinically unimportant improvement in pain compared to placebo. Mean reduction in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 = no pain) was 1.7 points with placebo and 2.3 points with antidepressants (mean difference (MD) −0.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.88 to −0.31; 9 trials, 2122 participants). Clinical response was defined as achieving a 50% or greater reduction in 24‐hour mean pain. High‐certainty evidence demonstrated that 45% of participants receiving antidepressants had a clinical response compared to 28.6% receiving placebo (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.82; 6 RCTs, 1904 participants). This corresponded to an absolute improvement in pain of 16% more responders with antidepressants (8.9% more to 26% more) and a number needed to treat for an additional beneficial effect (NNTB) of 6 (95% CI 4 to 11). High‐certainty evidence showed that the mean improvement in function (on 0 to 100 Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index, 0 = best function) was 10.51 points with placebo and 16.16 points with antidepressants (MD −5.65 points, 95% CI −7.08 to −4.23; 6 RCTs, 1909 participants). This demonstrates a small, clinically unimportant response. Moderate‐certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision) showed that quality of life measured using the EuroQol 5‐Dimension scale (−0.11 to 1.0, 1.0 = perfect health) improved by 0.07 points with placebo and 0.11 points with antidepressants (MD 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.07; 3 RCTs, 815 participants). This is clinically unimportant. High‐certainty evidence showed that total adverse events increased in the antidepressant group (64%) compared to the placebo group (49%) (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.41; 9 RCTs, 2102 participants). The number needed to treat for an additiona harmful outcome (NNTH) was 7 (95% CI 5 to 11). Low‐certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision for very low numbers of events) found no evidence of a difference in serious adverse events between groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.94; 9 RCTs, 2101 participants). The NNTH was 1000. Moderate‐certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision) showed that 11% of participants receiving antidepressants withdrew from trials due to an adverse event compared to 5% receiving placebo (RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.97; 6 RCTs, 1977 participants). The NNTH was 17 (95% CI 10 to 35). Authors' conclusions There is high‐certainty evidence that use of antidepressants for knee osteoarthritis leads to a non‐clinically important improvement in mean pain and function. However, a small number of people will have a 50% or greater important improvement in pain and function. This finding was consistent across all trials. Pain in osteoarthritis may be due to a variety of causes that differ between individuals. It may be that the cause of pain that responds to this therapy is only present in a small number of people. There is moderate‐certainty evidence that antidepressants have a small positive effect on quality of life with heterogeneity between trials. High‐certainty evidence indicates antidepressants result in more adverse events and moderate‐certainty evidence indicates more withdrawal due to adverse events. There was little to no difference in serious adverse events (low‐certainty evidence due to low numbers of events). This suggests that if antidepressants were being considered, there needs to be careful patient selection to optimise clinical benefit given the known propensity for adverse events with antidepressant use. Future trials should include alternative antidepressant agents or phenotyping of pain in people with osteoarthritis, or both. Plain language summary Antidepressants for osteoarthritis Background Osteoarthritis is a disease of the joints characterised by reduced cartilage and narrowing of the space between the joints. It may result in pain, deformity and disability. Antidepressant medicines are thought to affect pain by modulating nerve pathways in the central nervous system. We aimed to evaluate the clinical benefits and harms of antidepressants for knee and hip osteoarthritis pain. Study characteristics This review is current to January 2021. We included nine clinical trials with 2122 participants comparing antidepressants to placebo (a dummy treatment) and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory medicines (which are widely used to relieve pain and reduce inflammation). More participants were female (70%) and the average age was 54.4 to 65.9 years. Seven trials examined only knee osteoarthritis. Two also included people with hip osteoarthritis. All trials compared antidepressants to placebo, with or without non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory medicines. Key results Compared with a placebo, antidepressants resulted in a small benefit. Pain Pain reduced by 0.59 points more on a 0‐ to 10‐point scale with antidepressants compared to placebo. – The placebo group had a pain reduction of 1.73 points. – The antidepressant group had a pain reduction of 2.32 points. Response A clinical response is considered a 50% or greater reduction in pain. About 16% more people taking an antidepressant had a reduction compared to placebo (that is, one in six people). – 28.65% of people taking placebo had a clinical response. – 45.2% of people taking antidepressants had a clinical response. Function Physical function is measured using walking, stair climbing and domestic duties. It improved 6% more with antidepressants compared to placebo. With antidepressants, the function score reduced by 5.65 on a 0‐ to 100‐point scale (lower score = better function), compared to placebo. This is a small improvement. – The placebo group had an improvement in function of 10.51 points. – The antidepressant group had an improvement in function of 16.16 points. Quality of life Quality of life improved by 4% more with antidepressants compared to placebo. This was 0.04 points higher on a −0.11 to 1 scale in people taking antidepressants compared to placebo (higher score = better quality of life). – In the placebo group, quality of life improved by 0.07 points. – In the antidepressant group, quality of life improved by 0.11 points. Withdrawals due to side effects The risk of stopping treatment was 2.15 more in the antidepressant group compared to placebo. This means that 1 in 17 people stopped taking the antidepressant because of side effects. – 5.1% of the placebo group withdrew because of side effects. – 10.9% of the antidepressant group withdrew because of side effects. Total side effects The risk of having any side effects was 1.27 more in the antidepressant group compared to the placebo group. About 14.8% more people reported a side effect in the antidepressant group. This is equivalent to 1 in every 7 people having a side effect. – 49.3% of the placebo group had a side effect. – 64.1% of the antidepressant group had a side effect. Serious side effects There was no difference in serious side effects between groups. – 1.7% of the placebo group had serious side effects. – 1.6% of the antidepressant group had serious side effects. Quality of the evidence In people with osteoarthritis, high‐quality evidence shows that antidepressants have a small positive effect on pain and function and that one in six people have a clinically important response of a 50% or greater reduction in their pain. High‐quality evidence also demonstrates that people taking antidepressants have a higher frequency of side effects than those taking placebo. Moderate‐quality evidence shows very small, probably unimportant, improvements in quality of life for people taking antidepressants compared to placebo. People receiving antidepressants are more likely to stop them because of side effects than placebo. Low‐quality evidence shows little difference in serious side effects between antidepressants and placebo."
J1812,2020,Are low and middle-income countries prioritising high-value healthcare interventions?,"<b>Introduction</b>: Since resources are finite, investing in services that produce the highest health gain 'return on investment' is critical. We assessed the extent to which low and middle-income countries (LMIC) have included cost-saving interventions in their national strategic health plans.
<b>Methods</b>: We used the Tufts Medical Center Global Health Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, an open-source database of English-language cost-per-disability-adjusted life year (DALY) studies, to identify analyses published in the last 10 years (2008-2017) of cost-saving health interventions in LMICs. To assess whether countries prioritised cost-saving interventions within their latest national health strategic plans, we identified 10 countries, all in sub-Saharan Africa, with the highest measures on the global burden of disease scale and reviewed their national health priority plans.
<b>Results</b>: We identified 392 studies (63%) targeting LMICs that reported 3315 cost-per-DALY ratios, of which 207 ratios (6%) represented interventions reported to be cost saving. Over half (53%) of these targeted sub-Saharan Africa. For the 10 countries we investigated in sub-Saharan Africa, 58% (79/137) of cost-saving interventions correspond with priorities identified in country plans. Alignment ranged from 95% (21/22 prioritised cost-saving ratios) in South Africa to 17% (2/12 prioritised cost-saving ratios) in Cameroon. Human papillomavirus vaccination was a noted priority in 70% (7/10) of national health prioritisation plans, while 40% (4/10) of countries explicitly included prenatal serological screening for syphilis. HIV prevention and treatment were stated priorities in most country health plans, whereas 40% (2/5) of countries principally outlined efforts for lymphatic filariasis. From our sample of 45 unique interventions, 36% of interventions (16/45) included costs associated directly with the implementation of the intervention.
<b>Conclusion</b>: Our findings indicate substantial variation across country and disease area in incorporating economic evidence into national health priority plans in a sample of sub-Saharan African countries. To make health economic data more salient, the authors of cost-effectiveness analyses must do more to reflect implementation costs and other factors that could limit healthcare delivery."
J2869,2021,A cost utility analysis of robotic versus open mitral valve repair in mitral valve regurgitation,"Objectives: For the first time this study carried out a cost-utility analysis comparing open surgical repair versus robotic minimally invasive surgical repair for Mitral Regurgitation. The respective benefits and costs of each treatment option gained from data in published literature have been analysed and subsequent suggestions for the allocation of resources and treatment recommendation will be offered. Method(s): The analysis was performed by including intraoperative and post-operative costs of the interventions and costs of the most prevalent complications associated with each operation. Thus, the Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) calculated will guide the decision of resource allocation by assessing whether the added cost of robotic surgery is justified given the NICE (National institute of Clinical Excellence) threshold of 30,000/QALY. The choice of perspective taken is through the lens of the British National Healthcare System. Result(s): The Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated was 4781.44/QALY. This ICER shows that if robotic surgery was to become gold standard, the NHS would be paying 4781.44/QALY gained per patient. Considering robotic surgery is associated with fewer complications for patients but also has a cost per QALY below the NICE threshold of 30,000/QALY, it seems that this is a fitting alternative to open heart mitral valve repair. After a sensitivity analysis accounting for the initial robotic capital investment the ICER resulted to 22,379.94/QALY, still below NICE's threshold. Conclusion(s): Our results have shown that robotic assisted minimally invasive repair of the mitral valve is a cost-effective option and can be implemented in the British national healthcare setting."
J2085,2020,Estimating the population health and economic impacts of introducing a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Malaysia- an economic evaluation,"Pneumococcal disease is a potentially fatal bacterial infection that is vaccine-preventable. Malaysia has yet to adopt a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) into its national immunization program (NIP). In 2016, pneumonia was the 3<sup>rd</sup> leading cause of death in children under five in Malaysia, accounting for 3.8% of under-five deaths. Introducing a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) is an effective strategy to reduce the disease burden. This study used a decision-analytic model to assess the potential impacts of introducing the available PCVs (13-valent and 10-valent) in Malaysia. Epidemiological and costs inputs were sourced from published literature. For each vaccination program, health outcomes and associated healthcare costs were estimated. The scenarios of initiating PCV13 vs. PCV10 and the status quo (no pneumococcal vaccine) were compared. Serotype trends of Finland and the U.K. were used to model the clinical impacts of PCV10 and PCV13 respectively. The base-case analysis used a societal perspective over a 5-year time horizon. Compared with PCV10, PCV13 was projected to avert an additional 190,628 cases of pneumococcal disease and 1126 cases of death. The acquisition of PCV13 was estimated to cost an incremental US$89,904,777, offset by a cost reduction of -US$250,219,914 on pneumococcal disease-related medical care and lost productivity. PCV13 demonstrated a higher cost-saving potential over PCV10. Compared with no vaccination, PCV13 was estimated as cost-saving. Results were robust across a series of sensitivity analyses. The introduction of PCV13 in a NIP was estimated to reduce a significant burden of disease and to be a cost-saving for the Malaysian health system."
J5902,2025,Syrian refugee and diaspora healthcare professionals: Case studies from the eastern mediterranean and European regions,"Thousands of Syrian healthcare professionals have been forced to leave Syria since the onset of the uprisings in March 2011 and subsequent descent into conflict. Initially, many stayed in the eastern mediterranean region; however, as the conflict became increasingly protracted and employment policies for Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) became increasingly restrictive, some moved elsewhere, particularly to Germany and the United Kingdom, both of which have aimed to capitalise on both refugee and diaspora HCPs to support human resources gaps in their health systems. Our aim is to explore the different policy practices towards Syrian refugee and diaspora HCPs in the eastern mediterranean and European regions. Method(s): We completed a narrative literature review and held a closed, virtual workshop in November 2022 in which 45 participants, most of whom had lived experience in the different refugee hosting contexts, participated. This allowed us to probe the primary themes arising from the literature review and the authors' observations and present our findings as case studies. Result(s): We explore through case studies from countries near Syria (Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Egypt) and in Europe (Germany, UK) different policies which support or restrict entry into the health workforce. For host countries, those which implement policies that support retraining, accreditation and entry into the workforce have the potential for sustained and cost-effective benefit to their health systems; the impact of this on the HCPs and health system needs further exploration. Without such policies, Syrian HCPs are forced to work in the informal health sector such as in Lebanon or Egypt, leading to potential exploitation and security risks. Discussion(s): Now is an important opportunity to support Syrian and other refugee HCPs who have been forced to leave their homes to capitalise on their skills to explore the impacts of potentially effective policies and interventions. Such policies that aim to invest in refugee HCPs' skills, further develop their aptitudes, and potentially establish a connection between them and their homeland in a mutually beneficial manner for both health systems in exile and in their homeland. Nonetheless, this topic still has large research gaps and remains in need of urgent research and data, particularly in view of the fall of the Syrian regime in December 2024 and its potential impacts.

Design A mixed methods study incorporating an online questionnaire, in-depth interviews and focus groups that were then analysed through a thematic analysis, underpinned by a constructivist approach. Settings An online mixed methods study of a defined cohort of participants who had completed the NHSDA course. Participants 26 participants were recruited to the study, of whom 50% were clinicians, 26.9% in management and 19.2% in data science. All had completed the 2-year NHSDA programme in Digital Health Leadership more than 6 months prior. Results Interviews and focus groups elicited two key areas of impact of the course: loco-regional digitisation and the development of a network of change agents. The dissertation project had direct effects on local digital transformation efforts. Most of these projects focused on clinician (11.7%) or service user (10.3%) engagement, as oppose to de novo digital processes (9.4%). The development of a network of digital leaders has facilitated communication between organisations and improved the efficiency of the national digital infrastructure. Conclusions A bespoke course incorporating a dissertation of practice model for digital health leaders can have broader impact for the attainment of digital priorities. This includes helping trusts to successfully adopt digital solutions, as well as fostering shared organisational learning. These influences, however, are mediated by resource and cultural barriers, which continue to hinder transformation efforts. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022."
J3116,2022,Communication of personalised disease risk by general practitioners to motivate smoking cessation in England: a cost-effectiveness and research prioritisation study,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Communication of personalised disease risk can motivate smoking cessation. We assessed whether routine implementation of this intervention by general practitioners (GPs) in England is cost-effective or whether we need further research to better establish its effectiveness. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) with value of information (VoI) analysis from the UK National Health Service perspective, using GP communication of personalised disease risk on smoking cessation versus usual care. SETTING: GP practices in England. STUDY POPULATION: Healthy smokers aged 35-60 years attending the GP practice. MEASUREMENTS: Effectiveness of GP communication of personalised disease risk on smoking cessation was estimated through systematic review and meta-analysis. A Bayesian CEA was then performed using a lifetime Markov model on smokers aged 35-60 years that measured lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) assigned to the four diseases contributing the most to smoking-related morbidity, mortality and costs: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, myocardial infarction and stroke. Costs and QALYs for each disease state were obtained from the literature. VoI analysis identified sources of uncertainty in the CEA and assessed how much would be worth investing in further research to reduce this uncertainty. FINDINGS: The meta-analysis odds ratio for the effectiveness estimate of GP communication of personalised disease risk was 1.48 (95% credibility interval, 0.91-2.26), an absolute increase in smoking cessation rates of 3.84%. The probability of cost-effectiveness ranged 89-94% depending on sex and age. VoI analysis indicated that: (i) uncertainty in the effectiveness of the intervention was the driver of the overall uncertainty in the CEA; and (ii) a research investment to reduce this uncertainty is justified if lower than 27.6 million (7 per smoker). CONCLUSION(S): Evidence to date shows that, in England, incorporating disease risk communication into general practitioners' practices to motivate smoking cessation is likely to be cost-effective compared with usual care.

J3117,2022,EE7 Economic Evaluation of COVID-19 Vaccines: A Targeted Literature Review,"Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic became a public health threat requiring the rapid development and distribution of vaccines around the world to help combat the virus. The objective of this study was to review and summarize published economic evaluations of COVID-19 vaccines with the aim of aiding the development of future models. Method(s): PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and other databases were searched from August 2021 to November 2021 to identify published literature of economic evaluations of COVID-19 vaccines. The studies identified were critically appraised and relevant data on the interventions and comparators, populations, perspectives, costs, utilities, time horizons, model structures, model types, and model outcomes from the included studies were extracted. Result(s): A total of 14 economic evaluations were identified through the targeted review including studies from the United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, Spain, South Africa, Ukraine, and Denmark. Evaluation of the studies found that a 1-year time horizon was modeled in most studies. Analyses were mostly conducted from a healthcare payer perspective; however, in some studies, the societal perspective was included. Dynamic state transition (semi-Markov) models or decision tree models were utilized in the studies identified. A common structure of health states was observed with most models including the states: susceptible, infected, recovered, and dead. The infected state was often split into several sub-states to account for varying degrees of symptom severity. Across all the studies reviewed, COVID-19 vaccines were estimated to be a cost-effective use of public resources. Among the key drivers of the model outcomes identified in the studies were the cost of the vaccines, vaccine effectiveness, vaccine coverage, and time horizon used. Conclusion(s): This research aids future economic evaluations of COVID-19 vaccines by providing an overview of previously published models, including methodologies and parameter inputs used.

J4891,2024,"Economical Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Treatment Using Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy, 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy and Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review","Objectives: Prostate cancer is a common form of cancer among men worldwide. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the economic evaluations of prostate cancer treatment strategies. Method(s): This systematic review was conducted using multiple electronic databases up to May 2021. English-language economic evaluation studies that compared intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT), and radical prostatectomy (RP) were included. The studies were evaluated using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist. The search yielded 1151 potentially relevant publications, which were screened based on the title and abstract. After the removal of duplicates, 55 studies remained, and 9 studies were screened in full text. Finally, textual data were analyzed manually using by-content analysis method. Result(s): All studies were cost-effective and evaluated quality-adjusted life year as the efficacy indicator. The studies were conducted from either payers' or health systems' perspectives, and the time horizon varied from 5 to 20 years. We included only full economic evaluation studies. The use of IMRT in comparison with 3DCRT was evaluated in 6 studies, based on which IMRT increased health and reduced side effects of treatment. According to incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) results, IMRT was more cost-effective than 3DCRT. Three studies evaluated the use of RP in comparison with radiotherapy. Based on these studies, radiotherapy was more effective than RP. Conclusion(s): IMRT was found to be more cost-effective than 3DCRT in all 6 studies compared with the threshold. Radiotherapy was found to be more effective than RP. However, long-term clinical trial studies are needed to confirm these findings and to provide more definitive conclusions.

J3985,2023,"HEPA Air Filters for Preventing Wildfire-Related Asthma Complications, a Cost-effectiveness Study","Rationale: Air pollution caused by wildfire smoke is linked to adverse health outcomes, especially for people living with asthma. We studied whether government rebates for high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, which reduce smoke particles indoors, are cost-effective in managing asthma and preventing exacerbations in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Method(s): A Markov model analyzed health states for asthma control, exacerbation severity, and death over a retrospective time-horizon of 5 years (2018-2022). Wildfire smoke-derived particulate matter (PM2.5) from the CanOSSEM model and relevant literature informed the model. The base case analysis assumed continuous use of the HEPA filter. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) resulting from varying rebates were computed for each Health Service Delivery Area (HSDA). Result(s): In the base case analysis, HEPA air filter use resulted in increased costs of $83.34 (SE=1.03) and increased QALYs of 0.0011 (SE=0.0001) per person. Average incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) among BC HSDAs was $74,652/QALY (SE=3,517), with ICERs ranging from $40,509 to $89,206 per QALY in HSDAs. Across the province, the intervention was projected to prevent 4,418 exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, 643 emergency department visits, and 425 hospitalizations during the 5-year time horizon. A full rebate was cost-effective in one of the 16 HSDAs across BC. The probability of cost-effectiveness ranged from 0.1% to 74.8% across HSDAs. A $100 rebate was cost-effective in most HSDAs. Conclusion(s): Our results indicate variable cost-effectiveness of HEPA filters in managing wildfire smoke-related asthma issues in BC. The effectiveness of government rebates varies by region but rebates up to two-thirds of the filter cost generally appear cost-effective, with a full rebate only cost-effective in Kootenay Boundary.
