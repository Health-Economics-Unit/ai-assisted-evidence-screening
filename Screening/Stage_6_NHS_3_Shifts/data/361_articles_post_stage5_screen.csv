J502,2019,Pdb16 Assessment of Cost-Effectiveness of a 0.2 Mcg/Day Fluocinolone Acetonide (Fac) Implant in Patients with Chronic Diabetic Macular Oedema (Dmo) in an Eye with Cataract,"Objectives: The fluocinolone acetonide 0.2 mug/day implant (FAc) is effective in improving visual acuity in patients with chronic diabetic macular oedema (cDMO) but is associated with worsening of cataract. A model previously suggested that FAc is cost-effective in patients with cDMO, who have undergone cataract surgery or not. The aim of this study was to update this model and assess the cost-effectiveness of FAc in the subgroup of patients with symptomatic cataract. Method(s): The existing Markov model was designed to assess costs and QALYs over lifetime in patients treated with FAc implant, compared to usual care (UC), consisting of laser photocoagulation and anti-VEGFs from the UK NHS perspective. Unit costs and health state utility values (HSUVs) were updated. The FAc price was NHS list price. HSUVs were obtained from the FAME trial using the VFQ-UI utility index. Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) with UC was supposed to be stable. Additional scenarios were considered, with BCVA decreasing over time in UC arm, according to real-world data, and with possibility of administering FAc after cataract surgery in the UC arm. Result(s): New HSUVs ranged from 0.48 for blind patients to 0.91 for patients with perfect vision in both eyes. The FAc strategy was more expensive compared to usual care, by 3,445 per patients over lifetime, and produced more QALYs (+0.247). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated at 13,932 per QALY gained. The ICER was sensitive to the baseline visual acuity, patients' age and the probability of cataract surgery. The probability of FAc being cost-effective was 66.1% at a threshold of 20,000 per QALY gained. Scenario analyses showed that the efficacy of UC had a strong influence on results, and ICER decreased to 1,686 per QALY gained when BCVA decreased under UC Conclusion(s): The FAc implant is a cost-effective treatment for cDMO in patients with symptomatic cataract.

J503,2019,Fluorides for preventing early tooth decay (demineralised lesions) during fixed brace treatment,"- Background Early dental decay or demineralised lesions (DLs, also known as white spot lesions) can appear on teeth during fixed orthodontic (brace) treatment. Fluoride reduces decay in susceptible individuals, including orthodontic patients. This review compared various forms of topical fluoride to prevent the development of DLs during orthodontic treatment. This is the second update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and previously updated in 2013. Objectives The primary objective was to evaluate whether topical fluoride reduces the proportion of orthodontic patients with new DLs after fixed appliances. The secondary objectives were to examine the effectiveness of different modes of topical fluoride delivery in reducing the proportions of orthodontic patients with new DLs, as well as the severity of lesions, in terms of number, size and colour. ParticipantÃ¢â‚¬Âassessed outcomes, such as perception of DLs, and oral healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life data were to be included, as would reports of adverse effects. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 1 February 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 1 February 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 1 February 2019), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 1 February 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria ParallelÃ¢â‚¬Âgroup, randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a fluorideÃ¢â‚¬Âcontaining product versus a placebo, no treatment or a different type of fluoride treatment, in which the outcome of enamel demineralisation was assessed at the start and at the end of orthodontic treatment. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently, in duplicate, conducted risk of bias assessments and extracted data. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain missing data or to ask for clarification of aspects of trial methodology. Cochrane's statistical guidelines were followed. Main results This update includes 10 studies and contains data from nine studies, comparing eight interventions, involving 1798 randomised participants (1580 analysed). One report contained insufficient information and the authors have been contacted. We assessed two studies as at low risk of bias, six at unclear risk of bias, and two at high risk of bias. Two placebo (nonÃ¢â‚¬Âfluoride) controlled studies, at low risk of bias, investigated the professional application of varnish (7700 or 10,000 parts per million (ppm) fluoride (F)), every six weeks and found insufficient evidence of a difference regarding its effectiveness in preventing new DLs (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 1.93; 405 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). One placebo (nonÃ¢â‚¬Âfluoride) controlled study, at unclear risk of bias, provides a low level of certainty that fluoride foam (12,300 ppm F), professionally applied every two months, may reduce the incidence of new DLs (12% versus 49%) after fixed orthodontic treatment (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57; 95 participants). One study, at unclear risk of bias, also provides a low level of certainty that use of a highÃ¢â‚¬Âconcentration fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm F) by patients may reduce the incidence of new DLs (18% versus 27%) compared with a conventional fluoride toothpaste (1450 ppm F) (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.00; 380 participants). There was no evidence for a difference in the proportions of orthodontic patients with new DLs on the teeth after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances for the following comparisons:Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â an amine fluoride and stannous fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination versus a sodium fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse,Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â an amine fluoride gel versus a nonÃ¢â‚¬Âfluoride placebo applied by participants at home once a week and by professional application every three months,Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â resinÃ¢â‚¬Âmodified glass ionomer cement versus lightÃ¢â‚¬Âcured composite resin for bonding orthodontic brackets,Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â a 250 ppm F mouthrinse versus 0 ppm F placebo mouthrinse,Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â the use of an intraoral fluorideÃ¢â‚¬Âreleasing glass bead device attached to the brace versus a daily fluoride mouthrinse. The last two comparisons involved studies that were assessed at high risk of bias, because a substantial number of participants were lost to followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. Unfortunately, although the internal validity and hence the quality of the studies has improved since the first version of the review, they have compared different interventions; therefore, the findings are only considered to provide low level of certainty, because none has been replicated by followÃ¢â‚¬Âup studies, in different settings, to confirm external validity. A patientÃ¢â‚¬Âreported outcome, such as concern about the aesthetics of any DLs, was still not included as an outcome in any study. Reports of adverse effects from topical fluoride applications were rare and unlikely to be significant. One study involving fluorideÃ¢â‚¬Âcontaining glass beads reported numerous breakages. Authors' conclusions This review found a low level of certainty that 12,300 ppm F foam applied by a professional every 6 to 8 weeks throughout fixed orthodontic treatment, might be effective in reducing the proportion of orthodontic patients with new DLs. In addition, there is a low level of certainty that the patient use of a high fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm F) throughout orthodontic treatment, might be more effective than a conventional fluoride toothpaste. These two comparisons were based on single studies. There was insufficient evidence of a difference regarding the professional application of fluoride varnish (7700 or 10,000 ppm F). Further adequately powered, randomised controlled trials are required to increase the certainty of these findings and to determine the best means of preventing DLs in patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment. The most accurate means of assessing adherence with the use of fluoride products by patients and any possible adverse effects also need to be considered. Future studies should follow up participants beyond the end of orthodontic treatment to determine the effect of DLs on patient satisfaction with treatment. Plain language summary Fluorides for preventing early tooth decay (demineralised lesions) during fixed brace treatment Review question Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ugly white or brown marks sometimes appear on the teeth during treatment with braces to straighten teeth. These are due to early tooth decay and usually occur with fixed, gluedÃ¢â‚¬Âon 'train track', braces, which make it more difficult to clean the teeth. We know that fluoride in toothpaste helps to prevent tooth decay and think that if extra fluoride is given to people wearing fixed braces, it will protect them from getting these marks. The aim of this Cochrane Oral Health's review was to look at how well fluorides help to prevent early tooth decay during fixed brace treatment and to find out the best way to get fluoride to the teeth. Background Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Wearing a fixed brace makes it harder for people to keep their teeth clean and may also cause pain. Pain can make it more difficult for people to brush their teeth. This can lead to a buildÃ¢â‚¬Âup of dental plaque around the brackets that attach the fixed brace to the teeth, and if the plaque stays on the tooth for long enough, it will cause early tooth decay, which looks like white or brown marks (demineralised lesions, also known as white spot lesions). People often wear braces for 18 months or longer and if the decay is left to progress, it can cause holes, which are sometimes bad enough to need fillings to be done in the teeth. Fluoride helps the tooth to heal, reducing tooth decay in people who are at risk of developing it. People receiving fixed brace treatment may be given different forms of fluoride treatment. It is important to think about how the fluoride gets to the teeth. Does the fluoride need to be placed by a dentist or dental nurse, or can people having treatment with braces apply the fluoride to their own teeth? Study characteristics Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ This review is upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate as of 1 February 2019. The review includes 10 studies but we could only use the information from nine studies involving 1798 randomised people. We have asked for more information about one study. The review looks at eight different ways of applying fluoride to the teeth. People taking part in the studies were all having treatment with fixed braces. The number of people with new decay on the teeth at end of fixed brace treatment, as well as the amount of decay in each person, were measured and counted. We compared the following treatments:Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â dentist or nurseÃ¢â‚¬Âapplied fluoride e.g. varnish, gel or foam,Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â patientÃ¢â‚¬Âapplied/used fluoride e.g. toothpaste, mouthwash, gel or foam, andÃ¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â materials that release fluoride over time e.g. glues, elastic bands. Key results Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ One study showed that when the dentist applies a foam with a high level of fluoride in it onto the teeth every time the patient is seen, this might reduce the risk of new decay. Another study found that if patients use a toothpaste with a higher level of fluoride than normal, then this might also reduce the risk of new marks on their teeth. No studies have shown that other ways of giving the teeth extra fluoride reduced the number and/or size of new decay on teeth in people wearing fixed braces. Harmful effects of the different ways of giving the teeth more fluoride were not reported in any of the included studies. Certainty of the evidence Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ The level of belief we have in these findings is low, due to the lack of studies testing the same fluorides and showing the same results.

J504,2019,Pmh28 Assessing the Life-Cycle Value Added of Second-Generation Antipsychotics in Sweden and the Uk: The Case of Risperidone,"To estimate the life-cycle value of risperidone - representative of Second-Generation Antipsychotics- relative to First Generation Antipsychotics to balance the view that cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) at launch are enough to guide access decisions. Study aims to drive the discussion on access and price, through recognition of the dynamic nature of value added by pharmaceutical innovation over the long-run. We estimated the number of patients with schizophrenia treated with risperidone in Sweden and the UK (1994-2017). We collected cost-effectiveness data from the literature of risperidone and haloperidol - representative of First-Generation Antipsychotics. We modelled the life-cycle uptake of risperidone to estimate the life-cycle incremental cost, incremental QALYs and Net monetary Benefit (NMB). We also assessed the life-cycle distribution of the consumer (the payer) and the producer (innovator) surpluses. For the UK, the producer surplus represents around 28% of the total surplus before patent expiration and around 5% after patent expiration. Life-cycle NMB for the health system is estimated at 1,116m. During the life-cycle, the NMB significantly increased in response to two events: (i) the launch of Risperidone Long-Acting Injectable (RLAI); and (ii) generic entry. The ICER was negative (dominant) for the whole period. For Sweden, the producer surplus represents around 6% of the total surplus before patent expiration and around 1% after generic competition. Life-cycle NMB is estimated at 803m, and both NMB and ICER follow the same pattern as in the UK. Analysis shows that health systems appropriated most of the life-cycle value (surplus) generated. This suggests that, considering the entire life-cycle, the value added by SGAs to the system is higher than the value estimated using cost-effectiveness analysis at launch. Pricing and reimbursement decisions should take into account the dynamic nature of pharmaceutical markets and the value added by innovative medicines over the long-run.

J505,2019,Fetal fibronectin testing for reducing the risk of preterm birth,"- Background Fetal fibronectin (FFN) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein localized at the maternalÃ¢â‚¬Âfetal interface of the amniotic membranes, between chorion and decidua, where it is concentrated in this area between decidua and trophoblast. In normal conditions, FFN is found at very low levels in cervicovaginal secretions. Levels greater than or equal to 50 ng/mL at or after 22 weeks have been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth. In fact, FFN is one of the best predictors of preterm birth in all populations studied so far, and can help in selecting which women are at significant risk for preterm birth. This is an update of a review first published in 2008. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of management based on knowledge of FFN testing results for preventing preterm birth. Search methods For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and ChildbirthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Trials Register (7 September 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (7 September 2018), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of pregnant women screened with FFN for risk of preterm birth. Studies included are based exclusively on knowledge of FFN results versus no such knowledge, and we have excluded studies including women with only positive or only negative FFN results. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified 16 trials, of which six were eligible for inclusion. The six included studies randomized 546 women with singleton gestations and threatened preterm labor (PTL) at 23 0/7 to 34 6/7 weeks. A total of 277 women were randomized to knowledge and 269 to no knowledge of FFN. No trials were identified on asymptomatic women or multiple gestations. The risk of bias of included studies was mixed. For selected important outcomes, preterm birth before 37, 34, and 32 weeks, and maternal hospitalization, we graded the quality of the evidence and created a 'Summary of findings' table. For these outcomes, the evidence was graded as mainly low quality due to the imprecision of effect estimates. Management based on knowledge of FFN results may reduce preterm birth before 37 weeks (20.7%) versus controls without such knowledge (29.2%) (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.01; 5 trials; 434 women; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). However, management based on knowledge of FFN results may make little or no difference to preterm birth before 34 (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.18; 4 trials; 357 women; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) or maternal hospitalization (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.43; 5 trials; 441 women; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). The evidence for preterm birth before 32 weeks is uncertain because the quality was found to be very low (average RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.96; 4 trials; 357 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). For all other outcomes, for which there were available data (preterm birth less than 28 weeks; gestational age at delivery (weeks); birthweight less than 2500 g; perinatal death; tocolysis; steroids for fetal lung maturity; time to evaluate; respiratory distress syndrome; neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission; and NICU days), knowledge of FFN results may make little or no difference to the outcomes. Authors' conclusions The evidence from this review suggests that management based on knowledge of FFN results may reduce preterm birth before 37 weeks. However, our confidence in this result is limited as the evidence was found to be of low quality. Effects on other substantive outcomes are uncertain due to serious concerns in study design, inconsistency, and imprecision of effect estimates. No trials were identified on asymptomatic women, or multiple gestations. Future studies are needed that include specific populations (e.g. singleton gestations with symptoms of preterm labor), a study gro p managed with a protocol based on the FFN results, and that report not only maternal but also important perinatal outcomes. CostÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness analyses are also needed. Plain language summary Fetal fibronectin testing for reducing the risk of preterm birth What is the issue? To assess the effectiveness of management of pregnant women based on a knowledge of fetal fibronectin test results for preventing preterm birth, compared with not having that knowledge. Fetal fibronectin (FFN) acts as a Ã¢â‚¬ËœglueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ between the pregnancy and the uterus. Normally very low levels of FFN can be found in secretions of the vagina and cervix. Raised levels at or after 22 weeks have been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth. Why is this important? Preterm birth before 37 weeks is the main cause of sickness and death for newborn infants. Most women who give birth preterm have preterm labor symptoms such as contractions but many of the women with symptoms go on to deliver at term (37 weeks or more). Fetal fibronectin (FFN) is a test that can identify the women with symptoms of preterm labor who are most at risk for preterm birth. The level of FFN is measured in secretions from the vagina or cervix. What evidence did we find? We found six randomised controlled studies involving 546 women who were pregnant with one baby and were showing signs of preterm labor at between 23 to 34 weeks' gestation. We graded the following evidence as mainly low quality because of the low number of women in the studies and a wide variation in findings. We found that the number of births before 37 weeks may be slightly reduced when women and their doctors know the results of the FFN test (20.7% versus 29.2%; 5 trials; 434 women). However, knowledge of FFN results may make little or no difference for the other outcomes with available data, including: maternal hospitalization (5 trials; 441 women); use of uterine relaxants (tocolysis) to try to prevent labor; earlier preterm births; womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gestational age at delivery; babies with a birthweight less than 2500 g; newborn deaths; the number of babies with respiratory distress syndrome; giving steroids to mature the unborn babiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lungs; and number of days in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). What does this mean? This review of six studies did not find enough evidence to say whether or not the FFN test should be used in the management of women showing signs of preterm labor. A screening test such as FFN can only be considered effective if interventions based on the screening results, such as giving drugs to relax the uterus, reduce the number of preterm births.

J506,2019,Cervical assessment by ultrasound for preventing preterm delivery,"- Background Measurement of cervical length by ultrasound is predictive of preterm birth (PTB). There are three methods of ultrasound cervical assessment: transvaginal (TVU), transabdominal (TAU), and transperineal (TPU, also called translabial). Cervical length measured by TVU is a relatively new screening test, and has been associated with better prediction of PTB than previously available tests. It is unclear if cervical length measured by ultrasound is effective for preventing PTB. This is an update of a review last published in 2013. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of antenatal management based on transvaginal, transabdominal, and transperineal (also called translabial) ultrasound screening of cervical length for preventing preterm birth. Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and ChildbirthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov , and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) to 30 August 2018; reviewed the reference lists of all articles, and contacted experts in the field for additional and ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCT) including pregnant women between the gestational ages of 14 to 32 weeks, for whom the cervical length was screened for risk of PTB with TVU, TAU, or TPU. This review focused on studies based on knowledge versus no knowledge of cervical length results, or ultrasound versus no ultrasound for cervical length. We excluded studies based on interventions (e.g. progesterone, cerclage) for short cervical length. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methods. Main results We included seven RCTs (N = 923): one examined asymptomatic women with twin pregnancies; four included women with singleton pregnancies and symptoms of preterm labour (PTL); one included women with singleton pregnancies and symptoms of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM); and one included asymptomatic singletons. All trials used TVU for screening. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies as mixed, and the quality of the evidence for primary outcomes as very low for all populations. For asymptomatic women with twin pregnancies, it is uncertain whether knowledge of TVUÃ¢â‚¬Âmeasured cervical length compared to no knowledge reduces PTB at less than 34 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.30 to 1.25; 1 study, 125 participants) because the quality of the evidence is very low. The results were also inconclusive for preterm birth at 36, 32, or 30 weeks; gestational age at birth, and other maternal and perinatal outcomes. Four trials examined knowledge of TVUÃ¢â‚¬Âmeasured cervical length of singletons with symptoms of PTL versus no knowledge. We are uncertain of the effects because of inconclusive results and very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence for: preterm births at less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.32; 2 studies, 242 participants; IÃ‚Â² = 66%; TauÃ‚Â² = 0.23). Birth occurred about four days later in the knowledge groups (mean difference (MD) 0.64 weeks, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.25; 3 trials, 290 women). The results were inconclusive for the other outcomes for which there were available data: PTB at less than 34 or 28 weeks; birthweight less than 2500 g; perinatal death; maternal hospitalisation; tocolysis; and steroids for fetal lung maturity. The trial of singletons with PPROM (N = 92) evaluated safety of using TVU to measure cervical length in this population as its primary outcome, not its effect on management. The results were inconclusive for incidence of maternal and neonatal infections between the TVU and no ultrasound groups. In the trial of asymptomatic singletons (N = 296), in which women either received TVU or not, the results were inconclusive for preterm birth at less than 37 weeks (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.61; IÃ‚Â² = 0%), gestational age at birth, and other perinatal and maternal outcomes. We downgraded evidence for limitations in study design, inconsistency between the trials, and imprecision, due to small sample si e and wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. No trial compared the effect of knowledge of the CL with no knowledge of CL in other populations, such as asymptomatic women with singleton pregnancies, or symptomatic women with twin pregnancies. Authors' conclusions There are limited data on the effects of knowing the cervical length, measured by ultrasound, for preventing preterm births, which preclude us from drawing any conclusions for women with asymptomatic twin or singleton pregnancies, singleton pregnancies with PPROM, or other populations and clinical scenarios. Limited evidence suggests that knowledge of transvaginal ultrasoundÃ¢â‚¬Âmeasured cervical length, used to inform the management of women with singleton pregnancies and symptoms of preterm labour, appears to prolong pregnancy by about four days over women in the no knowledge groups. Future studies could look at specific populations separately (e.g. singleton versus twins; symptoms versus no symptoms of PTL), report on all pertinent maternal and perinatal outcomes, and include costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness analyses. Most importantly, future studies should include a clear protocol for management of women based on TVUÃ¢â‚¬Âmeasured cervical length. Plain language summary Cervical assessment by ultrasound for preventing preterm delivery We set out to assess the effectiveness of knowing the cervical length, measured with ultrasound, for preventing preterm birth compared with not knowing the cervical length. What is the issue? The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. When women are not pregnant, it is normally at least 3 cm long. During pregnancy, a short cervical length is associated with a risk of spontaneous preterm birth. The shorter the cervical length, the greater the risk. Therefore, measuring cervical length by ultrasound can help predict spontaneous preterm birth. The cervical length is measured by an ultrasound scan through the vagina (transvaginal or TVU), abdomen (transabdominal), or the perineum (transperineal). The most common causes of spontaneous preterm birth are preterm labour or preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Many of the interventions used to prevent preterm birth are used once symptoms develop. Why is this important? Preterm birth before 37 weeks is the main cause of a newborn baby being sick and disabled, or dying. The cervix is the opening or passage through which the baby must pass before being born vaginally. Ultrasound can detect early changes of the cervix, such as shortening of the cervical length, to predict preterm birth. On identifying a short cervical length, interventions can be applied to prevent preterm birth. These interventions include giving the expectant mother progesterone to relax the uterus, or applying a stitch, known as a cerclage, to tighten the opening of the cervix. What evidence did we find? This review assessed if knowing the cervical length can prevent preterm birth. We included seven randomised controlled studies, which involved 923 pregnant women at 14 to 32 weeks' gestation. One study included expectant mothers with twins, without any symptoms of preterm birth or labour, and looked at the number of babies born prematurely before 36 weeks. Four studies included expectant mothers of single babies with threatened preterm labour, and one study involving women with premature rupture of the membranes looked at the safety of transvaginal ultrasound. One trial included expectant mothers with singleton pregnancies who did not have any symptoms of preterm birth or labour to look at the efficacy of transvaginal ultrasound cervical length screening. All studies used transvaginal ultrasound to assess cervical length. For women with twin pregnancies and not showing symptoms of preterm birth, we are unclear of the impact of knowing the cervical length on whether babies are born before 34 weeks' gestation, or their gestational age at birth (1 study, 125 women), because we assessed the quality of the evidence to be very low. For women with a single baby and threatened preterm labour, knowledge of their cervical length may have led to a longer pregnancy by about four days (4 studies, 410 women), but the evidence on the number of babies born before 37 weeks was unclear (2 studies, 242 women). For women whose waters had broken, it is unclear whether healthcare provider knowledge makes any difference to whether the women gave birth preterm, or on the number of infections, again because we judged the quality of evidence as very low. For women with singleton pregnancies not showing symptoms of preterm birth, it is unclear whether an ultrasound to measure cervical length made any difference to whether their babies were born before 37 weeks' gestation (1 study, 296 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). What does this mean? We found a limited number of studies including small numbers of women. The studies varied in their design and had a broad spread of results. Women were not blinded to whether they had an ultrasound or not. Currently, there is not enough high quality research to show if knowledge of cervical length in women with twin or singleton pregnancies has any effect. Future studies could include ways of managing women as a result of the cervical length results, and it would be useful to look at specific populations separately, such as single babies versus twins and women with and without symptoms of preterm labour. They could also report on all important maternal and perinatal outcomes, and include costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness analyses.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,"Study involves antenatal ultrasound screening, likely in NHS or community health settings.",TRUE,"Unclear publication type, flagged for review",Unknown,0.6,TRUE,RCTs with comparator and clinical/safety outcomes,TRUE,No intervention/Do nothing,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety', 'utilization']",0.9
J508,2019,Adalimumab for non-infectious uveitis: Is it cost-effective?,"Background/Aims: Uveitis is inflammation inside the eye. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adalimumab compared with current practice (immunosuppressants and systemic corticosteroids) in patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior or panuveitis and to identify areas for future research. Method(s): A Markov model was built to estimate costs and benefits of the interventions. Systematic reviews were performed to identify the available relevant clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence. Data collected in two key randomised controlled trials (VISUAL I and VISUAL II) were used to estimate the interventions' effectiveness compared with the trials' comparator arms (placebo plus limited current practice (LCP)). The analysis was performed from the National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. Costs were calculated based on standard UK sources. Result(s): The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of adalimumab versus LCP for the base case are 92 600 and 318 075 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for active and inactive uveitis, respectively. In sensitivity analyses, the ICER varied from 15 579 to 120 653 and 35 642 to 800 775 per QALY for active and inactive uveitis. Conclusion(s): The estimated ICERs of adalimumab versus LCP are above generally accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness in the UK. Adalimumab may be more cost-effective in patients with active uveitis at greater risk of blindness. However, there is an unmet need for additional primary data to provide more reliable estimates in several important areas, including effectiveness of adalimumab versus current practice (instead of LCP), incidence of long-term blindness, adalimumab effectiveness in avoiding blindness, and rates and time to remission while on adalimumab.

J509,2019,"Burden of varicella complications in secondary care, England, 2004 to 2017","Background: Strategies to control varicella vary across Europe. Evidence from established programmes has prompted the United Kingdom to re-evaluate the need for universal vaccination. The burden of complicated varicella is a key parameter in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Aim(s): Our objective was to estimate the burden of complicated varicella in England. Method(s): This electronic health record surveillance study used data from all NHS hospitals in England to identify varicella admissions between 2004 and 2017. The incidence of pre-defined complications of varicella was estimated using ICD-10 codes. Inpatient costs were calculated based on the payment rules for providers of NHS services. Result(s): There were 61,024 admissions with varicella between 2004 and 2017 and 38.1% had a recognised varicella complication. Incidence of hospitalisation increased by 25% and the proportion with complicated varicella by 24% from 2004/05 to 2016/17. The most common complications were bacterial skin infections (11.25%), pneumonia (4.82%), febrile convulsions (3.39%) and encephalitis (2.44%). Complication rates were higher in older age groups and the type of complications more severe. Length of stay for complicated varicella was 3.1 times longer than for uncomplicated varicella and inpatient costs were 72% greater. Conclusion(s): Complicated varicella has a substantial health and economic burden. These data together with data on impact on quality of life are important in informing the cost-effectiveness analysis of universal varicella vaccination.

J510,2019,Treatment for hepatorenal syndrome in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis,"- Background Hepatorenal syndrome is defined as renal failure in people with cirrhosis in the absence of other causes. In addition to supportive treatment such as albumin to restore fluid balance, the other potential treatments include systemic vasoconstrictor drugs (such as vasopressin analogues or noradrenaline), renal vasodilator drugs (such as dopamine), transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and liver support with molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS). There is uncertainty over the best treatment regimen for hepatorenal syndrome. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for hepatorenal syndrome in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trial registers until December 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials on hepatorenal syndrome in people with cirrhosis. Selection criteria We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status) in adults with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently identified eligible trials and collected data. The outcomes for this review included mortality, serious adverse events, any adverse events, resolution of hepatorenal syndrome, liver transplantation, and other decompensation events. We performed a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio (OR), rate ratio, hazard ratio (HR), and mean difference (MD) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an availableÃ¢â‚¬Âcase analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. Main results We included a total of 25 trials (1263 participants; 12 interventions) in the review. TwentyÃ¢â‚¬Âthree trials (1185 participants) were included in one or more outcomes. All the trials but two were at high risk of bias, and all the evidence was of low or very low certainty. The trials included participants with liver cirrhosis of varied aetiologies as well as a mixture of type I hepatorenal syndrome only, type II hepatorenal syndrome only, or people with both type I and type II hepatorenal syndrome. Participant age ranged from 42 to 60 years, and the proportion of females ranged from 5.8% to 61.5% in the trials that reported this information. The followÃ¢â‚¬Âup in the trials ranged from one week to six months. Overall, 59% of participants died during this period and about 35% of participants recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. The most common interventions compared were albumin plus terlipressin, albumin plus noradrenaline, and albumin alone. There was no evidence of a difference in mortality (22 trials; 1153 participants) at maximal followÃ¢â‚¬Âup between the different interventions. None of the trials reported healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life. There was no evidence of differences in the proportion of people with serious adverse events (three trials; 428 participants), number of participants with serious adverse events per participant (two trials; 166 participants), proportion of participants with any adverse events (four trials; 402 participants), the proportion of people who underwent liver transplantation at maximal followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (four trials; 342 participants), or other features of decompensation at maximal followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (one trial; 466 participants). Five trials (293 participants) reported number of any adverse events, and five trials (219 participants) reported treatment costs. Albumin plus noradrenaline had fewer numbers of adverse events per participant (rate ratio 0.51, 95% CrI 0.28 to 0.87). Eighteen trials (1047 participants) reported recovery from hepatorenal syndrome (as per definition of hepatorenal syndrome). In terms of recovery from hepatorenal syndrome, in the direct comparisons, albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin plus octreotide had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome than albumin plus terlipressin (HR 0.04; 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.25 and HR 0.26, 95% CrI 0.07 to 0.80 respectively). There was no evidence of differences between the groups in any of the other direct comparisons. In the network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis, albumin and albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome compared with albumin plus terlipressin. Funding: two trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies; five trials were funded by parties who had no vested interest in the results of the trial; and 18 trials did not report the source of funding. Authors' conclusions Based on very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, there is no evidence of benefit or harm of any of the interventions for hepatorenal syndrome with regards to the following outcomes: allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality, serious adverse events (proportion), number of serious adverse events per participant, any adverse events (proportion), liver transplantation, or other decompensation events. LowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence suggests that albumin plus noradrenaline had fewer 'any adverse events per participant' than albumin plus terlipressin. LowÃ¢â‚¬Â or very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence also found that albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone had lower recovery from hepatorenal syndrome compared with albumin plus terlipressin. Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered; employ blinding, avoid postÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomisation dropouts or planned crossÃ¢â‚¬Âovers (or perform an intentionÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âtreat analysis); and report clinically important outcomes such as mortality, healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life, adverse events, and recovery from hepatorenal syndrome. Albumin plus noradrenaline and albumin plus terlipressin appear to be the interventions that should be compared in future trials. Plain language summary Treatment of hepatorenal syndrome What is the aim of this Cochrane review? To find out the best treatment for decreased kidney function (hepatorenal syndrome) in people with liver cirrhosis (a form of advanced liver disease with scarring of the liver) with complications. The authors collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question and found 25 randomised controlled trials (participants receive the treatment based on method similar to coin toss or lottery; this is to ensure that the people who receive the different treatments are similar in all aspects except the treatment, so that any differences in the results between the treatments can be attributed to the treatment rather than differences in the type of people who received the treatment). During analysis of data, authors used standard Cochrane techniques, which allows comparison of two treatments at a time. Authors also used advanced techniques, that allow comparison of many treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis' or 'multiple treatment comparisons'). The aim is to gather reliable evidence on the relative benefits and harms of the different treatments. Date of literature search Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ December 2018 Key messages Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Only two studies were conducted well. The remaining studies had one or more flaws. Therefore, there is high uncertainty in the results of the analysis. The authors could not recommend one treatment over another on the basis of risk of death, serious complications, percentage of people who developed any complication, percentage of participants who underwent liver transplantation (replacement of a diseased liver with a healthy one), or the number of other liver failure events. HealthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life was not reported in any of the trials. The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline. Funding source was unclear in 18 studies. Industrial organisations funded two studies and the remaining five studies did not receive any funding from industrial organisations. What was studied in the review? This review studied people of any sex, age, and origin, having advanced liver disease due to various causes, and who had developed hepatorenal syndrome. People were administered different treatments. The review authors excluded studies with liverÃ¢â‚¬Âtransplanted participants. Participants age, when reported, ranged from 42 to 60 years. The number of females ranged from 6 to 62 out of 100 in the studies that reported this information. The main treatments compared were albumin alone, albumin plus terlipressin, and albumin plus noradrenaline. The authors gathered and analysed data on death, quality of life, serious and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âserious complications, time to liver transplantation, recovery from hepatorenal syndrome, and disappearance of symptoms. What were the main results of the review? The 25 studies included a small number of participants (1263 participants). Study data were sparse. TwentyÃ¢â‚¬Âthree studies with 1185 participants provided data for analyses. The followÃ¢â‚¬Âup in the trials ranged from one week to six months. The review shows that: Ã¢â‚¬Â About 60 out of every 100 people died within three months, and 35 out of every 100 people recovered from hepatorenal syndrome. Ã¢â‚¬Â The provided treatment may make no difference to the percentage of people who died or developed serious complications, number of serious complications per person, percentage of people who developed complications of any severity, or the percentage of people undergoing liver transplantation. Ã¢â‚¬Â None of the trials reported healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life. Ã¢â‚¬Â The number of complications of any severity was lower with albumin plus noradrenaline than albumin plus terlipressin. Ã¢â‚¬Â Recovery from hepatorenal syndrome may be lower with albumin plus midodrine plus octreotide and albumin alone than albumin plus terlipressin and albumin plus noradrenaline.

J513,2019,OnceÃ¢â‚¬Âdaily versus multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âdaily dosing with intravenous aminoglycosides for cystic fibrosis,"- Background People with cystic fibrosis, who are chronically colonised with the organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa , often require multiple courses of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations. The properties of aminoglycosides suggest that they could be given in higher doses less often. This is an update of a previously published review. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and safety of onceÃ¢â‚¬Âdaily versus multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âdaily dosing of intravenous aminoglycoside antibiotics for the management of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis. Search methods We searched the Cystic Fibrosis Specialist Register held at the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's editorial base, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching relevant journals and handsearching abstract books of conference proceedings. Date of the most recent search: 31 January 2019. We also searched online trial registries. Date of latest search: 25 February 2019. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials, whether published or unpublished, in which onceÃ¢â‚¬Âdaily dosing of aminoglycosides has been compared with multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âdaily dosing in terms of efficacy or toxicity or both, in people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis The two authors independently selected the studies to be included in the review and assessed the risk of bias of each study; authors also assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE criteria. Data were independently extracted by each author. Authors of the included studies were contacted for further information. As yet unpublished data were obtained for one of the included studies. Main results We identified 15 studies for possible inclusion in the review. Five studies reporting results from a total of 354 participants (aged 5 to 50 years) were included in this review. All studies compared onceÃ¢â‚¬Âdaily dosing with thriceÃ¢â‚¬Âdaily dosing. One crossÃ¢â‚¬Âover trial had 26 participants who received the firstÃ¢â‚¬Âarm treatment but only 15 received the second arm. One study had a low risk of bias for all criteria assessed; the remaining included studies had a high risk of bias from blinding, but for other criteria were judged to have either an unclear or a low risk of bias. There was little or no difference between treatment groups in: forced expiratory volume in one second, mean difference (MD) 0.33 (95% confidence interval (CI) Ã¢â‚¬Â2.81 to 3.48, moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence); forced vital capacity, MD 0.29 (95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â6.58 to 7.16, lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence); % weight for height, MD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.82 (95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â3.77 to 2.13, lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence); body mass index, MD 0.00 (95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.42 to 0.42, lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence); or in the incidence of ototoxicity, relative risk 0.56 (95% CI 0.04 to 7.96, moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). OnceÃ¢â‚¬Âdaily treatment in children probably improved the percentage change in creatinine, MD Ã¢â‚¬Â8.20 (95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â15.32 to Ã¢â‚¬Â1.08, moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence), but showed no difference in adults, MD 3.25 (95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â1.82 to 8.33, moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). The included trials did not report antibiotic resistance patterns or quality of life. Authors' conclusions OnceÃ¢â‚¬Â and threeÃ¢â‚¬Âtimes daily aminoglycoside antibiotics appear to be equally effective in the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. There is evidence of less nephrotoxicity in children. Plain language summary Giving aminoglycoside antibiotics intravenously once daily compared to giving them several times per day in people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence to show the differences between giving intravenous antibiotics once daily compared to giving them several times a day when treating flare ups of disease (pulmonary exacerbations) in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of an earlier review. Background Most people with cystic fibrosis develop persistent lung infections and they may receive frequent courses of intravenous antibiotics to treat pulmonary exacerbations. Giving the a tibiotics just once per day rather than several doses per day reduces the cost of treatment and the time involved. Search date The evidence is current to 31 January 2019. Study characteristics This review includes five studies with a total of 354 children and adults. All the trials compared onceÃ¢â‚¬ÂaÃ¢â‚¬Âday dosing with three timesÃ¢â‚¬ÂaÃ¢â‚¬Âday dosing. Key results The review found that when treating people with cystic fibrosis for pulmonary exacerbations, giving the antibiotics once per day was just as good at as giving them more frequently in terms of lung function and body mass index. The review also found that giving the antibiotics once per day appeared to be less toxic to the kidneys in children. There were no differences between the different treatment schedules for other outcomes that the studies measured. While onceÃ¢â‚¬Âdaily treatment can be just as effective and more convenient than threeÃ¢â‚¬Âtimes daily treatment, we recommend further studies to look at the longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm safety of this treatment schedule. Quality of the evidence We judged that just one of the five studies carried a low risk that any design factors might affect the outcome results. In the remaining four studies, we thought that the fact that it was obvious whether the antibiotics were given once or three times a day could affect some outcome measures (e.g. lung function). Other risk factors were unclear or at low risk of bias.

J514,2019,Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Primary closure versus delayed or no closure for traumatic wounds due to mammalian bite,"- Background Mammalian bites are a common presentation in emergency and primary healthcare facilities across the world. The World Health Organization recommends postponing the suturing of a bite wound but this has not been evaluated through a systematic review. Objectives To assess the effects of primary closure compared with delayed closure or no closure for mammalian bite wounds. Search methods In July 2019 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including InÃ¢â‚¬ÂProcess & Other NonÃ¢â‚¬ÂIndexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials which compared primary closure with delayed or no closure for traumatic wounds due to mammalian bite. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and fullÃ¢â‚¬Âtext publications, applied the inclusion criteria, and extracted data. We pooled data using a randomÃ¢â‚¬Âeffects model, as appropriate. We used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results We found three trials (878 participants) that compared primary closure with no closure for dog bites and one trial (120 participants) that compared primary closure with delayed closure. No other mammalian bite studies were identified. The trials were from the UK (one trial), Greece (one trial) and China (two trials). Overall, participants from both sexes and all age groups were represented. We are uncertain whether primary closure improves the proportion of wounds which are infectionÃ¢â‚¬Âfree compared with no closure, as the certainty of evidence for this outcome was judged to be very low (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.05; 2 studies, 782 participants; I 2 = 0%). We downgraded the evidence by one level for high risk of bias and two levels for imprecision. There is no clinically important difference in cosmesis (acceptable physical/cosmetic appearance) of dog bite wounds when primary closure is compared with no closure (mean difference (MD) Ã¢â‚¬Â1.31, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â2.03 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.59; 1 study, 182 participants). The certainty of evidence for this outcome was judged to be moderate (we downgraded our assessment by one level for imprecision). We are uncertain whether primary closure improves the proportion of dog bite wounds that are infectionÃ¢â‚¬Âfree compared with delayed closure, as the evidence for this outcome was judged to be very low (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; 1 study, 120 participants; I 2 = 0%). We downgraded the evidence by one level for high risk of bias and two levels for imprecision. None of the four trials reported any adverse outcomes such as death or rabies but they were, in any case, unlikely to have been large enough to have satisfactory power to provide precise estimates for these. Important outcomes like time to complete wound healing, proportion of wounds healed, and length of hospital stay were not evaluated. Authors' conclusions All the studies we identified concerned dog bites. There is no highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence to support or refute existing recommendations concerning primary closure for dog bites. The potential benefits and harms of primary closure compared with delayed or no closure for mammalian bites remain uncertain and more robust trials are needed. Plain language summary Primary closure (immediate stitches) versus delayed closure (delayed stitches) or no closure (no stitches) for traumatic wounds due to mammalian bite What is the aim of this review? The aim of this review was to find out whether animal bite wounds heal better when they are closed with stitches straight away (primary closure), or if th wounds are left open to heal for a short time before closure (delayed closure) or not stitched at all (no closure). We wanted to find out which wounds healed fastest, and if the method of closure affected the likelihood of wound infection, the appearance of the scar, the length of time patients were in hospital, and more serious side effects such as death. To answer this question, we collected and analysed all relevant studies (randomised controlled trials). Randomised controlled trials are medical studies where people are chosen at random to receive different treatments. This type of trial provides the most reliable health evidence. We found four relevant studies. Key messages All the studies we found concerned dog bites. In terms of wound infection, we cannot be certain whether it is better to close dog bite wounds straight away, or wait a while before stitching, or leave them with no stitches. There was little difference in the appearance of the bite scar. Most of the evidence we found was of low certainty due to the size of the studies and the methods used. What was studied in the review? Mammalian bite wounds from animals such as dogs, cats and monkeys are a common problem throughout the world. In developed countries, many bite wounds are caused by domestic pets. In lowerÃ¢â‚¬Âincome countries bites can also be caused by wild animals. Dogs are generally responsible for the majority of bites. Bite wounds are at high risk of infection as microbes are transmitted into the wound from the animal's mouth. In lowerÃ¢â‚¬Âincome countries these wound infections can lead to serious complications and in some cases death. The first priorities when treating an animal bite are to stop the flow of blood from the wound, provide pain relief, and prevent infection. This can include appropriate vaccination against tetanus and rabies. It is often recommended that bite wounds are not stitched straight away if infection is suspected, as closing an infected wound could delay healing and be potentially fatal. What are the main results of the review? In July 2019 we searched for randomised controlled trials comparing primary closure versus delayed or no closure for mammalian bite wounds. We found four relevant studies on dog bites. They were carried out in the UK, Greece and China. No other mammalian bite studies were identified. Three of the studies we included compared primary closure with sutures (immediate stitches) with no closure for dog bite wounds. One study compared primary closure with delayed closure for dog bites. The people in the studies were followed, where stated, from 14 days to three months. Overall, participants from both sexes and all age groups were represented. We are uncertain whether primary closure of dog bite wounds increases the proportion of wounds which are infectionÃ¢â‚¬Âfree compared with no closure (very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence from two studies including a total of 782 people) and compared with delayed closure (very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence from one study with a total of 120 people). There is little difference in the appearance of dog bite wounds when primary closure is compared with no closure (moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence from one study with a total of 182 participants). None of the included studies reported proportion of wounds healed, the time to complete wound healing, length of hospital stay or adverse events. The number of people in the included studies was small, and the people who assessed the outcomes were aware of which treatment had been given. Both of these are reasons why the results are uncertain.

J515,2019,What evidence is available to support the development of a regional specialist neurorehabilitation outreach service,"Background The WHO recognises several specialist rehabilitation provision models; in-patient, outpatient and outreach. Intensive early neurorehabilitation is required after severe Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), usually necessitating in-patient care. In the UK, children receiving specialist neurorehabilitation often remain in-patients for long periods because of the lack of appropriate out-of-hospital provision. Aims To explore feasibility and funding implications of developing a regional specialist neurorehabilitation outreach service to facilitate earlier discharge. Methods Analysis of data on children receiving in-patient neurorehabilitation at a paediatric Regional Neuroscience Centre (RNSC), 2014-2018. Information concerning therapy provision was obtained from Trust Clinical Information System Suite (CISS). Patient dependency and rehabilitation complexity was assessed by Rehabilitation Complexity Scale-Extended (RCS-E), scored by multi-disciplinary team (MDT) at weekly meetings over 15 months. For modelling purposes, a specialist neurorehabilitation outreach tariff equating to 50% in-patient tariff was assumed. Data analysis was undertaken by linear programming model (XpressIveÃ‚Â©) and Discrete-Even Simulation (Simul8 Ã‚Â©).Various eligibility criteria for outreach provision were modelled: 1) needing >=1 therapies<3 times/week; 2) Total RCS-E score <9,<11 or<13; 3) Therapy Dependency (TD) +Therapy Intensity (TI) components of RCS-E <5. Results 156 children received neurorehabilitation as in-patients over 4 years. Mean age=7.34 years (range 0.1-17). 66 (55%) were male, 53 (45%) female. 84% had ABI, others acquired spinal injury, acute polyneuropathy or somatisation disorders. 52% lived >40 miles from RNSC, 47%>60 min' drive away. 49% were inpatients 1-28 days; 34%, 29-84 days; 18, 85-168 days; 6,>168 days. Patients showed significant functional improvements between admission to neurorehabilitation and discharge (p<0.001). Modelling suggests 14 outreach centres, including RNSC, would be required to permit 78% patients to access specialist neurorehabilitation <30 mins drive from home; 10 centres would permit 92% to access neurorehabilitation <45 min' drive away; 8 centres would permit 96% to access neurorehabilitation <60 min' drive away. Calculations assuming outreach tariff=50% in-patient tariff, and various RCS data models, suggest annual cost savings ranging from 53,424-166,950; calculations based on CISS data, suggest average savings of 1 05 596 per year (range 98,500-113,526).

J520,2019,The budget impact of early dose optimisation with golimumab in ulcerative colitis in the UK,"Background: The PURSUIT study found that ulcerative colitis patients who were non-responders (based on full Mayo score) to subcutaneous golimumab treatment at Week 6 may benefit from receiving a dose of 100 mg golimumab from Week 6 onwards, with 28% of non-responders at Week 6 becoming responders by Week 14. The aim of this study was to assess the budget implications of optimising a patient's dose at Week 6 compared with other first-line therapies as per current clinical practice Methods: A decision tree model was designed to follow a patient's response to first-line treatment and to track a patient's progression through subsequent line of therapy. The budget impact model only considered drug costs from the perspective of the UK NHS. In total three lines of therapy were covered by the decision tree over a 1 year time horizon. Patients could have first-line treatment with one of the three treatment strategies; golimumab (current treatment practice), golimumab (dose optimisation based on the PURSUIT trial) and adalimumab. Within each of the comparator treatments dose escalation was considered, based on the median time to escalation and proportion of patients receiving dose escalation. Subsequent therapy for golimumab patients was adalimumab and patients who received adalimumab as a first-line therapy received golimumab as a second-line therapy. Response rates, time to loss of response and treatment costs were taken from published data sources. The cost of golimumab was equal between 50 mg pack and 100 mg pack. The model used assumption for second-line response rates; this has been tested in sensitivity analysis. Result(s): The use of dose optimisation for golimumab does not increase expenditure of drug costs compared with golimumab (single dose) with a cost saving of 42 per patient per year. When comparing dose optimisation for golimumab to adalimumab, golimumab was cost saving over 1 year of treatment with cost saving of 2138 per patient. The number of patients in a response health state was similar across all three treatments (47.7%, 47.6% and 45% for golimumab (single dose), golimumab (dose optimisation) and adalimumab, respectively. Conclusion(s): The implementation of dose optimisation at Week 6 for golimumab was cost saving compared with golimumab (current treatment practice) or adalimumab. The analysis highlights the need for immediate implementation of the updated GLM label in clinical practice for potentially more cost savings.",TRUE,Study applied to UK NHS setting.,TRUE,Study assesses budget impact in UK NHS context.,TRUE,Appears to be a peer-reviewed article with no exclusion indicators.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative cost analysis with explicit comparators and cost outcomes.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,['cost'],0.95
J521,2019,Pcv98 Pcsk9 Inhibitors: An Analysis of Current Uptake and Potential Opportunities in England,"Objectives: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects approximately 6 million people in England and costs the NHS an estimated 7 billion a year. A key risk factor for CVD is hypercholesterolaemia. PCSK9 inhibitors, such as alirocumab and evolocumab, are a treatment option for patients who, despite taking the maximum tolerated dose of statins, still have cholesterol higher than recommended levels. This study compares actual prescription of PCSK9 inhibitors with expected use and considers opportunities for improved access to these drugs. Method(s): An analysis of the initial uptake estimates from the NICE resource impact report for alirocumab and evolocumab and actual daily dose (ADD) prescribing data from the NICE innovation scorecard for the same drugs in 2018. The study included a review of the NICE technology appraisal guidance (TAG) for alirocumab (TA393) and evolocumab (TA394), and publications from 2016-2019 relating to uptake of, and guidance and initiatives associated with, PCSK9 inhibitors in England. Result(s): On publication of the TAG for alirocumab and evolocumab in 2016, NICE estimated that there would be 11,542 people receiving PCSK9 inhibitors by 2018. However, analysis of data from the NICE innovation scorecard for 2018 shows that 755,806 ADDs of alirocumab and evolocumab were actually prescribed. This is equivalent to approximately 2,069 people receiving treatment and indicates that uptake of PCSK9 inhibitors was 82% lower than expected in 2018. Conclusion(s): While there is considerable potential for PCSK9 inhibitors to alleviate some of the burden of CVD, prescription of these drugs is considerably lower than expected. Despite price reduction, the cost of PCSK9 inhibitors may remain the main barrier to access to these drugs. Further barriers could include a lack of clear guidance for clinicians, patient identification and, until recently, limited clinical trial data regarding CVD outcomes. New initiatives, such as the Accelerated Access Collaborative, may ultimately lead to improved access to PCSK9 inhibitors.

J522,2019,Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion versus multiple daily injection regimens in children and young people at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes: Pragmatic randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation,"Objective To compare the efficacy, safety, and cost utility of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with multiple daily injection (MDI) regimens during the first year following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children and young people. Design Pragmatic, multicentre, open label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation. Setting 15 paediatric National Health Service (NHS) diabetes services in England and Wales. The study opened to recruitment in May 2011 and closed in January 2017. Participants Patients aged between 7 months and 15 years, with a new diagnosis of type 1 diabetes were eligible to participate. Patients who had a sibling with the disease, and those who took drug treatments or had additional diagnoses that could have affected glycaemic control were ineligible. Interventions Participants were randomised, stratified by age and treating centre, to start treatment with CSII or MDI within 14 days of diagnosis. Starting doses of aspart (CSII and MDI) and glargine or detemir (MDI) were calculated according to weight and age, and titrated according to blood glucose measurements and according to local clinical practice. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was glycaemic control (as measured by glycated haemoglobin; HbA1c) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were percentage of patients in each treatment arm with HbA1c within the national target range, incidence of severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, change in height and body mass index (as measured by standard deviation scores), insulin requirements (units/kg/day), partial remission rate (insulin dose adjusted HbA1c <9), paediatric quality of life inventory score, and cost utility based on the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from an NHS costing perspective. Results 294 participants were randomised and 293 included in intention to treat analyses (CSI, n=144; MDI, n=149). At 12 months, mean HbA1c was comparable with clinically unimportant differences between CSII and MDI participants (60.9 mmol/mol v 58.5 mmol/mol, mean difference 2.4 mmol/mol (95% confidence interval -0.4 to 5.3), P=0.09). Achievement of HbA1c lower than 58 mmol/mol was low among the two groups (66/143 (46%) CSII participants v 78/142 (55%) MDI participants; relative risk 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.67 to 1.06)). Incidence of severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis were low in both groups. Fifty four non-serious and 14 serious adverse events were reported during CSII treatment, and 17 non-serious and eight serious adverse events during MDI treatment. Parents (but not children) reported superior PedsQL scores for those patients treated with CSII compared to those treated with MDI. CSII was more expensive than MDI by 1863 (2179; $2474; 95% confidence interval 1620 to 2137) per patient, with no additional QALY gains (difference -0.006 (95% confidence interval -0.031 to 0.018)). Conclusion During the first year following type 1 diabetes diagnosis, no clinical benefit of CSII over MDI was identified in children and young people in the UK setting, and treatment with either regimen was suboptimal in achieving HbA1c thresholds. CSII was not cost effective. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN29255275; European Clinical Trials Database 2010-023792-25.

J523,2019,Perioperative betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers for preventing surgeryÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing nonÃ¢â‚¬Âcardiac surgery,"- Background Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus routine prescription of these drugs in an unselected population remains a controversial issue. A previous version of this review assessing the effectiveness of perioperative betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers in cardiac and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âcardiac surgery was last published in 2018. The previous review has now been split into two reviews according to type of surgery. This is an update, and assesses the evidence in nonÃ¢â‚¬Âcardiac surgery only. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of perioperatively administered betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers for the prevention of surgeryÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing nonÃ¢â‚¬Âcardiac surgery. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis Previews and Conference Proceedings Citation IndexÃ¢â‚¬ÂScience on 28 June 2019. We searched clinical trials registers and grey literature, and conducted backwardÃ¢â‚¬Â and forwardÃ¢â‚¬Âcitation searching of relevant articles. Selection criteria We included RCTs and quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized studies comparing betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers with a control (placebo or standard care) administered during the perioperative period to adults undergoing nonÃ¢â‚¬Âcardiac surgery. If studies included surgery with different types of anaesthesia, we included them if 70% participants, or at least 100 participants, received general anaesthesia. We excluded studies in which all participants in the standard care control group were given a pharmacological agent that was not given to participants in the intervention group, studies in which all participants in the control group were given a betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblocker, and studies in which betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers were given with an additional agent (e.g. magnesium). We excluded studies that did not measure or report review outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. Main results We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 participants; we found no quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized studies. All participants were undergoing nonÃ¢â‚¬Âcardiac surgery, and types of surgery ranged from low to high risk. Types of betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. In nine studies, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers were titrated according to heart rate or blood pressure. Duration of administration varied between studies, as did the time at which drugs were administered; in most studies, it was intraoperatively, but in 18 studies it was before surgery, in six postoperatively, one multiÃ¢â‚¬Âarm study included groups of different timings, and one study did not report timing of drug administration. Overall, we found that more than half of the studies did not sufficiently report methods used for randomization. All studies in which the control was standard care were at high risk of performance bias because of the openÃ¢â‚¬Âlabel study design. Only two studies were prospectively registered with clinical trials registers, which limited the assessment of reporting bias. In six studies, participants in the control group were given betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers as rescue therapy during the study period. The evidence for allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality at 30 days was uncertain; based on the risk of death in the control group of 25 per 1000, the effect with betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers was between two fewer and 13 more per 1000 (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.54; 16 studies, 11,446 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction by 13 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.87; 12 studies, 10,520 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.81; 6 studies, 9460 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), or in ventricular arrhythmias (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.47; 5 studies, 47 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may reduce atrial fibrillation or flutter by 26 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; 9 studies, 9080 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). However, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may increase bradycardia by 55 more incidences per 1000 (RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.74 to 3.56; 49 studies, 12,239 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), and hypotension by 44 more per 1000 (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.51; 49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence owing to study limitations; some studies had high risks of bias, and the effects were sometimes altered when we excluded studies with a standard care control group (including only placeboÃ¢â‚¬Âcontrolled trials showed an increase in early mortality and cerebrovascular events with betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers). We also downgraded for inconsistency; one large, wellÃ¢â‚¬Âconducted, international study found a reduction in myocardial infarction, and an increase in cerebrovascular events and allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality, when betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers were used, but other studies showed no evidence of a difference. We could not explain the reason for the inconsistency in the evidence for ventricular arrhythmias, and we also downgraded this outcome for imprecision because we found few studies with few participants. Authors' conclusions The evidence for early allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality with perioperative betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers was uncertain. We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events or ventricular arrhythmias, and the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes was low and very low. We found lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence that betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may reduce atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarctions. However, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may increase bradycardia (lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and probably increase hypotension (moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Further evidence from large placeboÃ¢â‚¬Âcontrolled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life. We found 18 studies awaiting classification; inclusion of these studies in future updates may also increase the certainty of the evidence. Plain language summary BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers to prevent death or serious events after surgery not involving the heart This review assessed evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on whether betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers reduce deaths or other serious events when given to people undergoing surgery other than heart surgery. The findings for heart surgery are covered in another review. Background Surgery increases stress in the body, which responds by releasing the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Stress from surgery can lead to death or other serious events such as heart attacks, stroke, or an irregular heartbeat. For surgery that does not involve the heart, an estimated 8% of people may have injury to their heart around the time of surgery. BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers are drugs that block the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers can slow down the heart, and reduce blood pressure, and this may reduce the risk of serious events. However, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may lead to a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure which could increase the risk of death or a stroke. Prevention of early complications after surgery is important, but using betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers to prevent these complications is controversial. Study characteristics The evidence is current to 28 June 2019. We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 adults who were undergoing different types of surgery other than heart surgery. Eighteen studies are awaiting classification (because we did not have enough details to assess them), and three studies are ongoing. The types of betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers used in the studies were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. Studies compared these betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers with either a placebo (disguised to look like a betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblocker but containing no medicine) or with standard care. Key results BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may make l ttle or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days of surgery (16 studies, 11,446 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), have a stroke (6 studies, 9460 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), or experience ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat rhythms, starting in the main chambers of the heart, that are potentially lifeÃ¢â‚¬Âthreatening and may need immediate medical treatment; 5 studies, 476 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). We found that betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may reduce atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat, starting in the atrial chambers of the heart, that increases the risk of stroke if untreated; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low certaintyÃ¢â‚¬Âevidence), and the number of people who have a heart attack (12 studies, 10,520 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). However, taking betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may increase the number of people who experience a very low heart rate (49 studies, 12,239 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), or very low blood pressure (49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), around the time of surgery. In a few studies, we also found little or no difference in the number of people who died after 30 days, who died because of a heart problem, or had heart failure. We found no evidence of whether betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers alter the length of time in hospital. No studies assessed whether people who were given betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers had a better quality of life after heart surgery. Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence in this review was limited by including some studies that were at high risk of bias, and we noticed that some of our findings were different if we only included placeboÃ¢â‚¬Âcontrolled studies or studies that reported how participants were randomized. We also found one large, wellÃ¢â‚¬Âconducted, international study that had different findings to the smaller studies. It showed a reduction in heart attacks and an increase in stroke and allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality when betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers were used, whilst the other studies did not show a clear effect. We were also less certain of the findings for outcomes with few studies, such as for ventricular arrhythmias. Conclusion Although betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days, have a stroke, or have ventricular arrhythmias, they may reduce atrial fibrillation and heart attacks. Taking betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may increase the number of people with a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure around the time of surgery.

We excluded studies that did not measure or report review outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. Main results We included 63 studies with 7768 participants; six studies were quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized and the remaining were RCTs. All participants were undergoing cardiac surgery, and in most studies, at least some of the participants were previously taking betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers. Types of betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, sotalol, esmolol, landiolol, acebutolol, timolol, carvedilol, nadolol, and atenolol. In twelve studies, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers were titrated according to heart rate or blood pressure. Duration of administration varied between studies, as did the time at which drugs were administered; in nine studies this was before surgery, in 20 studies during surgery, and in the remaining studies betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers were started postoperatively. Overall, we found that most studies did not report sufficient details for us to adequately assess risk of bias. In particular, few studies reported methods used to randomize participants to groups. In some studies, participants in the control group were given betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers as rescue therapy during the study period, and all studies in which the control was standard care were at high risk of performance bias because of the openÃ¢â‚¬Âlabel study design. No studies were prospectively registered with clinical trials registers, which limited the assessment of reporting bias. We judged 68% studies to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Study authors reported few deaths (7 per 1000 in both the intervention and control groups), and we found lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence that betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may make little or no difference to allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality at 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.90; 29 studies, 4099 participants). For myocardial infarctions, we found no evidence of a difference in events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.52; 25 studies, 3946 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Few study authors reported cerebrovascular events, and the evidence was uncertain (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.67; 5 studies, 1471 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Based on a control risk of 54 per 1000, we found lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence that betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may reduce episodes of ventr cular arrhythmias by 32 episodes per 1000 (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.63; 12 studies, 2296 participants). For atrial fibrillation or flutter, there may be 163 fewer incidences with betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers, based on a control risk of 327 incidences per 1000 (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.59; 40 studies, 5650 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). However, the evidence for bradycardia and hypotension was less certain. We found that betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may make little or no difference to bradycardia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.91; 12 studies, 1640 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), or hypotension (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.80; 10 studies, 1538 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). We used GRADE to downgrade the certainty of evidence. Owing to studies at high risk of bias in at least one domain, we downgraded each outcome for study limitations. Based on effect size calculations in the previous review, we found an insufficient number of participants in all outcomes (except atrial fibrillation) and, for some outcomes, we noted a wide confidence interval; therefore, we also downgraded outcomes owing to imprecision. The evidence for atrial fibrillation and length of hospital stay had a moderate level of statistical heterogeneity which we could not explain, and we, therefore, downgraded these outcomes for inconsistency. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence of a difference in early allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, hypotension and bradycardia. However, there may be a reduction in atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias when betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers are used. A larger sample size is likely to increase the certainty of this evidence. Four studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of this review. Plain language summary BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers to prevent death or serious events after heart surgery This review assessed evidence of whether betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers given around the time of surgery can reduce death or other serious events for people undergoing heart surgery. Background People undergoing heart surgery are at greater risk of complications and death. Heart surgery increases the amount of stress in the body, causing the release of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. This stress can lead to serious events including death, heart attacks, stroke, or an irregular heartbeat. BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers are drugs that block the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers can slow down the heart and reduce blood pressure, and this effect may reduce the risk of serious events. However, they can also lead to a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure, and this effect may increase the risk of death or a stroke. Prevention of complications around the time of surgery is an important safety consideration for people undergoing heart surgery. Study characteristics The evidence is current to 28 June 2019. We included 63 studies with 7768 adults who were undergoing heart surgery, including coronary artery bypass graft and valve replacement surgery. Studies were mostly randomized controlled studies, and six were quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized (participants were allocated to groups by methods such as using hospital record numbers or dates of birth). The types of betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, sotalol, esmolol, landiolol, acebutolol, timolol, carvedilol, nadolol, and atenolol. These betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers were compared with either a placebo (disguised to look like a betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblocker but containing no medicine) or with standard care. BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers were started before surgery, during surgery or at the latest by the end of the first day after surgery. The length of time betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers were given varied between studies. In most studies, at least some of the people were already taking betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers, which would be expected for people who had conditions that needed heart surgery. Key results BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers probably make little or no difference to the number of people who die (29 studies, 4099 participants) or have a heart attack (25 studies, 3946 participants) within 30 days of surgery. This w s supported by lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence. Few studies reported on people who had a stroke, and we were uncertain whether or not betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers reduced strokes because the certainty of the evidence was very low (5 studies, 1471 participants). BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may reduce atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heartbeat starting in the atrial chambers of the heart that increases the risk of stroke if untreated (40 studies, 5650 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may also reduce ventricular arrhythmias, which are potentially lifeÃ¢â‚¬Âthreatening irregular heartbeat rhythms originating in the main chambers of the heart, and which may need immediate medical treatment (12 studies, 2296 participants). We found that betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may make little or no difference to whether people experience a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure. We were uncertain whether betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers made a difference to the number of deaths up to a year after surgery (3 studies, 511 participants), to death because of the heart (4 studies, 320 participants), or to people who had heart failure (3 studies, 311 participants). The certainty of this evidence was very low. People who took betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers had a shorter hospital stay by about half a day (14 studies, 2450 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). No studies assessed whether people on betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers had a better quality of life after heart surgery. Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence in this review was mostly low. We found that many studies reported methods that we believed could influence the results. For example, many studies did not use a placeboÃ¢â‚¬Âcontrol and the doctors might, therefore, have treated people differently in each group. We were unable to explain some of the differences that we found in the data for atrial fibrillation. We also needed to have evidence from a larger number of participants to be very confident in our findings. Conclusion BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may be beneficial for people who are undergoing cardiac surgery because they may reduce the number of people who experience atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias. BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may make little or no difference to the other outcomes in this review, including death, heart attacks or stroke.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,"Study involves cardiac surgery, likely in hospital settings.",TRUE,Peer-reviewed article on perioperative beta-blockers.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,RCTs with control group measuring mortality and morbidity.,TRUE,Placebo,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety']",0.95
J527,2019,Botulinum toxin type A in the treatment of lower limb spasticity in children with cerebral palsy,"- Background Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of physical disabilities in children in highÃ¢â‚¬Âincome countries. Spasticity is the most common motor disturbance in CP. Botulinum toxin type A (BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA) is considered the firstÃ¢â‚¬Âline treatment for focal spasticity in people with CP. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA compared to other treatments used in the management of lower limb spasticity in children with CP. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, PubMed, four other databases, and two trial registers in October 2018. We also searched the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews and contacted experts in the field. We did not apply any date or language restrictions. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of children with CP, aged between birth and 19 years, treated with BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA injections in the lower limb muscles compared to other interventions. The primary outcomes were gait analysis and function. The secondary outcomes were joint range of motion, quality of life, satisfaction, spasticity, and adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and rated the quality of the evidence using GRADE. A third review author arbitrated in case of disagreements. We conducted metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalyses of available data whenever possible, analysing dichotomous data with risk ratios (RR), and continuous data with mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We considered a 5% significance level for all analyses. Whenever possible, we analysed outcomes at the time points at which they were assessed: short term (2 to 8 weeks); medium term (12 to 16 weeks); and long term (> 24 weeks). Main results We included 31 randomised controlled trials assessing 1508 participants. Most studies included ambulatory patients with more than one motor type of CP, and with a mean age of between three and seven years. There was a slight predominance of males. Studies compared BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA in the lower limb muscles to usual care or physiotherapy (14 studies), placebo or sham (12 studies), serial casting (4 studies), or orthoses (1 study). We rated studies as at high or unclear risk of bias mainly due to random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment. BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA versus usual care or physiotherapy BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA might improve overall gait scores at mediumÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (MD 2.80, 95% CI 1.55 to 4.05; 1 study, 40 children; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) and is moderately effective at improving function at shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.95; 2 studies, 123 children) and mediumÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (SMD 1.04, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.91; 4 studies, 191 children) followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (all very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA improves ankle range of motion, satisfaction, and ankle plantarflexors spasticity at one or more time points (very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). The proportion of adverse events in the BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA group was 0.37 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.66; I 2 = 95%; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). No adverse events were reported in the control group. BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA versus placebo or sham BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA improves overall gait scores at shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.37, P = 0.006; 4 studies, 261 assessments) and mediumÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.74, P < 0.001; 3 studies, 248 assessments) followÃ¢â‚¬Âup, and may improve peak ankle dorsiflexion in stance (MD 15.90 degrees, 95% CI 4.87 to 26.93, P = 0.005; 1 study, 19 children) and in swing (MD 10.20 degrees, 95% CI 4.01 to 16.39, P = 0.001; 1 study, 19 children) at shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (all moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA is not more effective than placebo or sham at improving function at shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (SMD 0.24, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™0.35 to 0.83, P = 0.42; 4 studies, 305 children) or longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (SMD Ã¢Ë†â€™0.07, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™0.48 to 0.35, P = 0.76; 2 studies, 91 children) followÃ¢â‚¬Âup, but has a small positive effect at mediumÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.49, P = 0.01; 5 studies, 327 children) (all moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA improves passive ankle range of motion, satisfaction, and ankle plantarflexors spasticity at one or more time points (moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). There was no difference between groups in the rate of adverse events at shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.93, P = 0.21; 12 studies, 918 children; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA versus serial casting There was no difference between groups for overall gait scores at shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (MD 0.00, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™1.66 to 1.66); mediumÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (MD 0.65, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™1.21 to 2.51); or longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (MD 0.46, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™1.33 to 2.25) followÃ¢â‚¬Âup in one study with 18 children (moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA improved instrumented gait analysis only in terms of ankle dorsiflexion at initial contact (MD 6.59 degrees, 95% CI 1.39 to 11.78, P = 0.01; 2 studies, 47 children). There was no difference between groups for peak ankle dorsiflexion in stance and swing, and gait speed at any time point (moderateÃ¢â‚¬Â and lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA is not more effective than serial casting at improving function, ankle range of motion, and spasticity at any time point (moderateÃ¢â‚¬Â and lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA is not associated with a higher risk of adverse events than serial casting (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.03 to 11.03; 3 studies, 64 children; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA versus orthoses There was no difference between groups for function at mediumÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (MD 11.14, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™0.05 to 22.33; 1 study, 43 children), but BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA is more effective than orthoses at improving hip range of motion and hip adductors spasticity (all very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). Authors' conclusions The quality of the evidence was low or very low for most of the outcomes analysed. We found limited evidence that BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA is more effective than placebo or a nonÃ¢â‚¬Âplacebo control at improving gait, joint range of motion, satisfaction, and lower limb spasticity in children with CP, whereas the results for function were contradictory. The rate of adverse events with BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA is similar to placebo. BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA is not more effective than ankle serial casting to treat ankle contractures for any of the assessed outcomes, but is more effective than orthotics at improving range of motion and spasticity. Plain language summary Botulinum toxin type A injections for the treatment of lower limb spasticity in cerebral palsy Background Cerebral palsy (CP) is a nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprogressive, lifelong condition resulting from damage to the developing brain. Over time, most children with CP will develop abnormal muscle activity and stiffness/overactivity (spasticity) that affects at least one limb and interferes with their normal movement. Treatments for spasticity include physiotherapy, oral antispasticity drugs (a type of medication that works to relax the muscles and relieve spasticity), casts, splints, orthopaedic surgery, and botulinum toxin A (BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA; a poisonous biological substance that is thought to relieve spasticity by reducing muscle overactivity when injected into the muscle). This review looked at the effects of BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA. Review question The aim of this review was to assess and summarise scientific studies comparing BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA injections to other treatments for lower limb spasticity in children with CP. Study characteristics We found 31 studies assessing 1508 participants. The use of BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA in the lower limb muscles was compared to: (1) children's regular care or physiotherapy, (2) placebo (fake injections), (3) a series of belowÃ¢â‚¬Âknee plaster casts, and (4) leg splints. Key results Children receiving BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA injections tended to have improved walking pattern (gait), joint range of motion, satisfaction with outcome of treatment, and muscle spasms compared with their usual programme of care or physiotherapy, or placebo. Measures of function tended to show only modest improvements in children receiving BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA injections. The rate of side effects was similar when comparing BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA injections to placebo. BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA injections and plaster cas s below the knee produced similar benefits in walking and joint motion and relieving spasms. In addition, BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA provided better results in terms of joint range of motion compared to a specific type of splinting (Johnstone pressure splints). Quality of the evidence We considered the quality of the evidence as very low for the comparison BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA versus usual care or physiotherapy; moderate for the comparison BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA versus placebo; moderate and low for the comparison BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA versus plaster casts; and very low for the comparison BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA versus splints. Conclusion There is limited evidence that, compared to placebo or regular care, BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA improves walking, joint motion, satisfaction with the outcome of treatment, and muscle spasticity in children with CP. The rate of side effects with BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA was similar to placebo. BoNTÃ¢â‚¬ÂA was no better than plaster casts in any of our analyses, but was better than splints at improving range of motion and spasticity.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,"Study involves treatment of CP in children, likely in clinical settings.",TRUE,Peer-reviewed article with research findings,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,RCT with comparators and clinical outcomes,TRUE,Placebo,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety', 'pro']",0.95
J529,2019,Endometrial resection and ablation techniques for heavy menstrual bleeding,"- Background Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a significant health problem in premenopausal women; it can reduce their quality of life and can cause social disruption and physical problems such as iron deficiency anaemia. FirstÃ¢â‚¬Âline treatment has traditionally consisted of medical therapy (hormonal and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âhormonal), but this is not always successful in reducing menstrual bleeding to acceptable levels. Hysterectomy is a definitive treatment, but it is more costly and carries some risk. Endometrial ablation may be an alternative to hysterectomy that preserves the uterus. Many techniques have been developed to 'ablate' (remove) the lining of the endometrium. FirstÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration techniques require visualisation of the uterus with a hysteroscope during the procedure; although it is safe, this procedure requires specific technical skills. Newer techniques for endometrial ablation (secondÃ¢â‚¬Â and thirdÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration techniques) have been developed that are quicker than previous approaches because they do not require hysteroscopic visualisation during the procedure. Objectives To compare the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of endometrial destruction techniques to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in premenopausal women. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycInfo (from inception to May 2018). We also searched trials registers, other sources of unpublished or grey literature, and reference lists of retrieved studies, and we made contact with experts in the field and with pharmaceutical companies that manufacture ablation devices. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different endometrial ablation or resection techniques for women reporting HMB without known uterine pathology, other than fibroids outside the uterine cavity and smaller than 3 centimetres, were eligible. Outcomes included improvement in HMB and in quality of life, patient satisfaction, operative outcomes, complications, and the need for further surgery, including hysterectomy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for risk of bias, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for clarification of methods or for additional data. We assessed adverse events only if they were separately measured in the included trials. We undertook comparisons with individual techniques as well as an overall comparison of firstÃ¢â‚¬Â and secondÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration ablation methods. Main results We included in this update 28 studies (4287 women) with sample sizes ranging from 20 to 372. Most studies had low risk of bias for randomisation, attrition, and selective reporting. Less than half of these studies had adequate allocation concealment, and most were unblinded. Using GRADE, we determined that the quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. We downgraded evidence for risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. Overall comparison of secondÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration versus firstÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration (i.e. gold standard hysteroscopic ablative) techniques revealed no evidence of differences in amenorrhoea at 1 year and 2 to 5 years' followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.27; 12 studies; 2145 women; IÃ‚Â² = 77%; and RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.72; 672 women; 4 studies; IÃ‚Â² = 80%; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) and showed subjective improvement at 1 year followÃ¢â‚¬Âup based on a Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) (< 75 or acceptable improvement) (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; 5 studies; 1282 women; IÃ‚Â² = 0%; and RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.28; 236 women; 1 study; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). Study results showed no difference in patient satisfaction between secondÃ¢â‚¬Â and firstÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration techniques at 1 year followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 11 studies; 1750 women; IÃ‚Â² = 36%; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) nor at 2 to 5 years' followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 t 1.13; 672 women; 4 studies; IÃ‚Â² = 81%). Compared with firstÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration techniques, secondÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration endometrial ablation techniques were associated with shorter operating times (mean difference (MD) Ã¢â‚¬Â13.52 minutes, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â16.90 to Ã¢â‚¬Â10.13; 9 studies; 1822 women; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) and more often were performed under local rather than general anaesthesia (RR 2.8, 95% CI 1.8 to 4.4; 6 studies; 1434 women; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). We are uncertain whether perforation rates differed between secondÃ¢â‚¬Â and firstÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration techniques (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.01; 1885 women; 8 studies; IÃ‚Â² = 0%). Trials reported little or no difference between secondÃ¢â‚¬Â and firstÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration techniques in requirement for additional surgery (ablation or hysterectomy) at 1 year followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.26; 6 studies: 935 women; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). At 5 years, results showed probably little or no difference between groups in the requirement for hysterectomy (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.22; 4 studies; 758 women; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). Authors' conclusions Approaches to endometrial ablation have evolved from firstÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration techniques to newer secondÃ¢â‚¬Â and thirdÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration approaches. Current evidence suggests that compared to firstÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration techniques (endometrial laser ablation, transcervical resection of the endometrium, rollerball endometrial ablation), secondÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration approaches (thermal balloon endometrial ablation, microwave endometrial ablation, hydrothermal ablation, bipolar radiofrequency endometrial ablation, endometrial cryotherapy) are of equivalent efficacy for heavy menstrual bleeding, with comparable rates of amenorrhoea and improvement on the PBAC. SecondÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration techniques are associated with shorter operating times and are performed more often under local rather than general anaesthesia. It is uncertain whether perforation rates differed between secondÃ¢â‚¬Â and firstÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration techniques. Evidence was insufficient to show which secondÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration approaches were superior to others and to reveal the efficacy and safety of thirdÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration approaches versus firstÃ¢â‚¬Â and secondÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration techniques. Plain language summary Are newer methods for destroying the lining of the uterus (endometrial ablation) more effective and safer compared to established methods? Review question This review compared the effectiveness, safety, acceptability, and complication rates of firstÃ¢â‚¬Â, secondÃ¢â‚¬Â and thirdÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration methods available to destroy the endometrium (lining of the uterus) for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding (heavy periods) in premenopausal women. Background Medication and hysterectomy (surgery to remove the womb) used to be the main treatment options for heavy menstrual bleeding. Both are still effective and safe options, but available new treatments focus on removing the lining of the womb (endometrium) from which the bleeding comes. These procedures involve either removing the endometrium (resection) or destroying it with thermal (heat) energy from a laser, electrical instruments, or other devices (ablation). These treatments can stop or reduce menstrual bleeding. Study characteristics This review identified 28 randomised controlled trials undertaken in 4287 women. Most of the women knew which treatment they were receiving, which may have influenced their judgements about menstrual blood loss and satisfaction. Other aspects of study quality varied among trials. Evidence is current to May 2018. Nineteen of the 28 trials acknowledged that they received funding, supplies of equipment, or technical assistance from the pharmaceutical industry and from equipment manufacturers. Key results ModerateÃ¢â‚¬Â to very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence suggests that firstÃ¢â‚¬Â and secondÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration approaches were equally effective in the treatment of HMB. Newer (secondÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration) treatment approaches were safer in terms of rate of fluid overload, cervical lacerations, and haematometra, with similar rates of uterine perforation. The newer approaches (secondÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration ablation) w re quicker and were more likely to be done under local (rather than general) anaesthesia compared with firstÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration approaches. Most women in both groups were satisfied with results of the procedure. Not enough evidence is available to show which secondÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration approaches are superior to others, and information about thirdÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration approaches is not available for comparison. Quality of the evidence Evidence ranged from moderate to very low quality. Few studies were blinded, data were limited, and heterogeneity was substantial for some outcomes, leading to downgrading of the quality of evidence.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Endometrial ablation likely occurs in hospital or clinical settings.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article on endometrial techniques,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,RCT comparing techniques with clinical and PRO outcomes,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['clinical', 'pro', 'safety']",0.95
J530,2019,Cyclical progestogens for heavy menstrual bleeding,"- Background Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a menstrual blood loss perceived by women as excessive that affects the health of women of reproductive age, interfering with their physical, emotional, social and material quality of life. Whilst abnormal menstrual bleeding may be associated with underlying pathology, in the present context, HMB is defined as excessive menstrual bleeding in the absence of other systemic or gynaecological disease. The firstÃ¢â‚¬Âline therapy is usually medical, avoiding possibly unnecessary surgery. Of the wide variety of medications used to reduce HMB, oral progestogens were originally the most commonly prescribed agents. This review assesses the effectiveness of two different types and regimens of oral progestogens in reducing ovulatory HMB. This is the update of a Cochrane review last updated in 2007, and originally named Effectiveness of cyclical progestagen therapy in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding"" (1998). Objectives To determine the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of oral progestogen therapy taken either during the luteal phase (short cycle) or for a longer course of 21 days per cycle (long cycle), in achieving a reduction in menstrual blood loss in women of reproductive age with HMB. Search methods In January 2019 we searched Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility's specialized register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycInfo. We also searched trials registers, other sources of unpublished or grey literature and reference lists of retrieved trials. We also checked citation lists of review articles to identify trials. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatments for HMB that included cyclical oral progestogens were eligible. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted trial authors for clarification of methods or additional data when necessary. We only assessed adverse events if they were separately measured in the included trials. We compared cyclical oral progestogen in different regimens and placebo or other treatments. Our primary outcomes were menstrual blood loss and satisfaction with treatment; the secondary outcomes were number of days of bleeding, quality of life, compliance and acceptability of treatment, adverse events and costs. Main results This review identified 15 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1071 women in total. Most of the women knew which treatment they were receiving, which may have influenced their judgements about menstrual blood loss and satisfaction. Other aspects of trial quality varied among trials. We did not identify any RCTs comparing progestogen treatment with placebo . We assessed comparisons between oral progestogens and other medical therapies separately according to different regimens. ShortÃ¢â‚¬Âcycle progestogen therapy during the luteal phase (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone for 7 to 10 days, from day 15 to 19) was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the progestogenÃ¢â‚¬Âreleasing intrauterine system (PgÃ¢â‚¬ÂIUS (off the market since 2001)), releasing 60 mcg of progesterone daily, with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (mean difference (MD) 37.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 17.67 to 56.91; I 2 = 50%; 6 trials, 145 women, lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). The rate of satisfaction and the quality of life with treatment was similar in both groups. The number of bleeding days was greater on the short cycle progestogen group compared to other medical treatments. Adverse events (such as gastrointestinal symptoms and weight gain) were more likely with danazol when compared with progestogen treatment. We note that danazol is no longer in general use for treating HMB. LongÃ¢â‚¬Âcycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone), from day 5 to day 26 of the menstrual cycle, is also inferior compared to the levonorgestrelÃ¢â‚¬Âreleasing intrauterine system (LNGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIUS), tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, ut may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss (MD 16.88, 95% CI 10.93 to 22.84; I 2 = 87%; 4 trials, 355 women, very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference between progestogen therapy long cycle and other medical therapy in terms of headache (OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.40 to 5.31; I 2 = 0%; 2 trials, 189 women; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). Breakthrough bleeding or spotting was more likely in women with the LNGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIUS (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.55; I 2 = 0%; 3 trials, 220 women; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). No trials reported on days of bleeding or quality of life for this comparison. The evidence supporting these findings was limited by low or very low gradings of quality; thus, we are uncertain about the findings and there is a potential that they may change if we identify other trials. Authors' conclusions LowÃ¢â‚¬Â or very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence suggests that shortÃ¢â‚¬Âcourse progestogen was inferior to other medical therapy, including tranexamic acid, danazol and the PgÃ¢â‚¬ÂIUS with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss. Long cycle progestogen therapy (medroxyprogesterone acetate or norethisterone) was also inferior to the LNGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIUS, tranexamic acid and ormeloxifene, but may be similar to the combined vaginal ring with respect to reduction of menstrual blood loss. Plain language summary Are cyclical progestogens an effective and safe treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding compared to other medical treatments? Background Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is menstrual bleeding (periods) that interferes with a woman's quality of life, either physical, emotional, social or material, independently of the actual amount of blood loss. Most women with HMB do not have any associated physical cause, such as fibroids, so getting help that does not involve surgery is an attractive alternative. A cyclical progestogen is a hormone tablet that can be taken by mouth for either 10 days or 3 to 4 weeks per month for the treatment of HMB (short or long course cyclical progestogen). Trial characteristics This review identified 15 randomized controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with 1071 women in total comparing oral progestogens to other medical treatment for HMB (other oral treatments, intrauterine device and vaginal ring). Our primary outcomes were menstrual blood loss and satisfaction with treatment; the secondary outcomes were number of days of bleeding, quality of life, compliance and acceptability of treatment, adverse events and costs. Evidence is current to January 2019. Key results This review of trials found that progestogen hormone tablets taken by mouth for 10 days per month (short course) were less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss when compared to other medical treatments. We are uncertain whether they improved satisfaction or quality of life in women with HMB, or were associated with any difference in adverse effects when compared to other medical treatments. Even though it was less effective at reducing menstrual blood loss, satisfaction with treatment was similar to other medical treatments such as tranexamic acid and PgÃ¢â‚¬ÂIUS. We found that progestogen hormone tablets, taken by mouth for three to four weeks from day 5 to 26 of the menstrual cycle (long course), reduced menstrual blood loss but this treatment may be less effective than tranexamic acid, combined hormonal contraceptives and the levonorgestrelÃ¢â‚¬Âreleasing intrauterine device. No studies in this comparison reported on quality of life. Satisfaction with treatment was similar to women using the combined vaginal ring, but there were no data to compare satisfaction between long cycle and LNGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIUS or tranexamic acid. There was no evidence of a difference in the occurrence of headache, but long course oral progestogens were associated with a significantly lower incidence of breakthrough bleeding compared with other medical treatment. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence that compared oral progestogens (shor and long course) to other medical treatments for HMB was either low or very low which means that we are very uncertain of the findings of the review. The main limitations were risk of bias (women and researchers were aware of the treatment they were receiving which was likely to interfere with the responses, and there was a high number of dropouts from studies) and inconsistency (the results varied among studies).""",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Study likely occurs in community health settings for HMB treatment.,TRUE,"Cochrane review, likely peer-reviewed",Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,RCT with active comparator and primary outcomes on clinical impact and safety.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety', 'pro']",0.95
J535,2019,Interventions for prodromal stage of psychosis,"- Background Psychosis is a serious mental condition characterised by a loss of contact with reality. There may be a prodromal period or stage of psychosis, where early signs of symptoms indicating onset of first episode psychosis (FEP) occur. A number of services, incorporating multimodal treatment approaches (pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions), developed worldwide, now focus on this prodromal period with the aim of preventing psychosis in people at risk of developing FEP. Objectives The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of early interventions for people in the prodromal stage of psychosis. The secondary objective is, if possible, to compare the effectiveness of the various different interventions. Search methods We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's studyÃ¢â‚¬Âbased Register of studies (including trials registers) on 8 June 2016 and 4 August 2017. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions for participants older than 12 years, who had developed a prodromal stage of psychosis. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality. Main results We included 20 studies with 2151 participants. The studies analysed 13 different comparisons. Group A comparisons explored the absolute effects of the experimental intervention. Group B were comparisons within which we could not be clear whether differential interactive effects were also ongoing. Group C comparisons explored differential effects between clearly distinct treatments. A key outcome for this review was Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtransition to psychosisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. For details of other main outcomes please see 'Summary of findings' tables. In Group A (comparisons of absolute effects) we found no clear difference between amino acids and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.48 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 2.98; 2 RCTs, 52 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). When omegaÃ¢â‚¬Â3 fatty acids were compared to placebo, fewer participants given the omegaÃ¢â‚¬Â3 (10%) transitioned to psychosis compared to the placebo group (33%) during longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup of seven years (RR 0.24 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 81 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). In Group B (comparisons where complex interactions are probable) and in the subgroup focusing on antipsychotic drugs added to specific care packages, the amisulpiride + needsÃ¢â‚¬Âfocused intervention (NFI) compared to NFI comparison (no reporting of transition to psychosis; 1 RCT, 102 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) and the olanzapine + supportive intervention compared to supportive intervention alone comparison (RR 0.58 95% CI 0.28 to 1.18; 1 RCT, 60 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) showed no clear differences between groups. In the second Group B subgroup (cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT)), when CBT + supportive therapy was compared with supportive therapy alone around 8% of participants allocated to the combination of CBT and supportive therapy group transitioned to psychosis during followÃ¢â‚¬Âup by 18 months, compared with double that percentage in the supportive therapy alone group (RR 0.45 95% CI 0.23 to 0.89; 2 RCTs, 252 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). The CBT + risperidone versus CBT + placebo comparison identified no clear difference between treatments (RR 1.02 95% CI 0.39 to 2.67; 1 RCT, 87 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) and this also applies to the CBT + needsÃ¢â‚¬Âbased intervention (NBI) + risperidone versus NBI comparison (RR 0.75 95% CI 0.39 to 1.46; 1 RCT, 59 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). Group C (differential effects) also involved six comparisons. The first compared CBT with supportive therapy. No clear difference was found for the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtransition to psychosisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ outcome (RR 0.74 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98; 1 RCT, 72 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). The second subgroup compared CBT + supportive intervention was compared with a NBI + supportive intervention, again, data were equivocal, few and of very low quality (RR 6.32 95% CI 0.34 to 117.09; 1 RCT, 57 participants). In the CBT + risperidone versus supportive therapy comparison, again there was no clear difference between groups (RR 0.76 95% CI 0.28 to 2.03; 1 RCT, 71 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). The three other comparisons in Group C demonstrated no clear differences between treatment groups. When cognitive training was compared to active control (tablet games) (no reporting of transition to psychosis; 1 RCT, 62 participants; very low quality data), family treatment compared with enhanced care comparison (RR 0.54 95% CI 0.18 to 1.59; 2 RCTs, 229 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) and integrated treatment compared to standard treatment comparison (RR 0.57 95% CI 0.28 to 1.15; 1 RCT, 79 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) no effects of any of these approaches was evident. Authors' conclusions There has been considerable research effort in this area and several interventions have been trialled. The evidence available suggests that omegaÃ¢â‚¬Â3 fatty acids may prevent transition to psychosis but this evidence is low quality and more research is needed to confirm this finding. Other comparisons did not show any clear differences in effect for preventing transition to psychosis but again, the quality of this evidence is very low or low and not strong enough to make firm conclusions. Plain language summary Early interventions for people at risk of developing psychosis Review question Is there highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence indicating that interventions for people at risk of developing psychosis are effective? Background Psychoses are serious mental conditions characterised by a loss of contact with reality. The first clear episode of psychosis can be preceded by a 'prodromal' period of at least six months, where a person experiences gradual nonÃ¢â‚¬Âspecific changes in thoughts, perceptions, behaviours and functioning. Although an individual is experiencing changes, they have not yet started to experience the more obvious psychotic symptoms such as delusions (fixed false beliefs) or hallucinations (perceptions without a cause). A number of services with treatment approaches that combine pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychosocial treatments, developed worldwide, are now focusing on prevention of psychosis in people at risk by giving treatments during this prodromal period. This review assesses the evidence available concerning the effects of different treatment approaches for people not yet diagnosed with a non affective psychosis but who are in the prodromal stage of psychosis. Searching for evidence On 8 June 2016 and 4 August 2017 we ran electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia's specialised register of studies in order to find clinical studies that randomly allocated individuals at risk of developing psychosis to receive various treatments for preventing development of psychosis. Evidence found We were able to include 20 studies with 2151 participants. These studies analysed a wide range of treatments. All the review findings are of, at very best, low quality. There is some suggestion from one small study that people at risk of psychosis may benefit from taking omegaÃ¢â‚¬Â3 fatty acids in terms of reduced transition to psychosis. Other studies found adding antipsychotic drugs to supportiveÃ¢â‚¬Âcare packages did not seem to make much difference in terms of transition to full illness. When cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) + supportive therapy was compared with supportive therapy alone around 8% of participants treated allocated to the combination of CBT and supportive therapy transitioned to psychosis during followÃ¢â‚¬Âup by 18 months, compared with double that percentage in people who just received supportive therapy. This could be important but these data are of very low quality. All other testing of CBT and other packages of care found no clear difference between treatments for transition to psychosis. Conclusions There has been considerable effort and expense invested testing treatment approaches for prevention of the first episode of schizophr nia. Currently, there is some lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence suggesting that omegaÃ¢â‚¬Â3 fatty acids may be effective, but there is no highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence to suggest that any type of treatment is effective, and no firm conclusions can be made.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Interventions likely occur in community health settings.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article with study results.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,RCTs with placebo and active comparators measuring clinical outcomes.,TRUE,Placebo,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety']",0.95
J536,2019,Context-Specific Economic Evaluation for Molecular Pathology Tests: An Application in Colorectal Cancer in the West of Scotland,"Objectives The cost-effectiveness of molecular pathology testing is highly context dependent. The field is fast-moving, and national health technology assessment may not be relevant or timely for local decision makers. This study illustrates a method of context-specific economic evaluation that can be carried out in a limited timescale without extensive resources.Methods We established a multi-disciplinary group including an oncologist, pathologists and a health economist. We set out diagnostic and treatment pathways and costs using registry data, health technology assessments, guidelines, audit data, and estimates from the group. Sensitivity analysis varied input parameters across plausible ranges. The evaluation setting was the West of Scotland and UK NHS perspective was adopted. The evaluation was assessed against the AdHopHTA checklist for hospital-based health technology assessment.Results A context-specific economic evaluation could be carried out on a timely basis using limited resources. The evaluation met all relevant criteria in the AdHopHTA checklist. Health outcomes were expected to be at least equal to the current strategy. Annual cost savings of 637,000 were estimated resulting primarily from a reduction in the proportion of patients receiving intravenous infusional chemotherapy regimens. The result was not sensitive to any parameter. The data driving the main cost saving came from a small clinical audit. We recommended this finding was confirmed in a larger population.Conclusions The method could be used to evaluate testing changes elsewhere. The results of the case study may be transferable to other jurisdictions where the organization of cancer services is fragmented.

J537,2019,Screening Women for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms: Clinical and Economic Effectiveness Results from a Discrete Event Simulation Model,"Introduction - Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening programmes have been established for men in several countries. Whether screening should be extended to women is uncertain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of population screening for AAA in women, and compare a range of screening options. Methods - A discrete event simulation model was developed to provide a clinically realistic model of screening, surveillance, and elective and emergency AAA repair in women. Input parameters specifically for women were obtained from surgical registries, published literature and national administrative datasets. Screening was modelled for women aged 65 years or over. The model was run for 10-million women, with parameter uncertainty addressed by probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. UK costs in pounds sterling were converted to Euros based on 2016 average OECD purchasing power parity. Results - The prevalence of AAA (aortic diameter 33.0cm) was estimated as 0.43% in women aged 65 years and 1.15% at age 75. The corresponding attendance rates following invitation to screening were estimated as 73% and 62%. The base-case model adopted the same age at screening (65 years), definition of AAA (33.0cm), surveillance intervals (1 year for 3.0-4.4cm AAAs, 3 months for 4.5-5.4cm) and AAA diameter for consideration of surgery (5.5cm) as in the UK NHS AAA screening programmes. For screening at age 65, per woman invited to screening, the estimated gain in QALYs was 0.00075 (just under one day of life per woman screened), and the incremental cost was 33.51 (36.33) (all values discounted). This gave an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 45,000 (48,782) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (current UK threshold for implementation approximately 20,000 (21,681)). Under the base-case model around 2800 women would need to be invited to screening to prevent one death from AAA and screening would cost 100,000 (108,406) per death from AAA prevented (non-discounted). Sensitivity analyses did not bring the ICER below 20,000 per QALY gained, with the exception of doubling the AAA prevalence to 0.86% where the ICER was 18,000 (19,513). Alternative screening options (increasing the screening age to 70 years, lowering the threshold for considering surgery to 5.0 or 4.5cm, lowering the diameter defining an AAA in women to 2.5cm, and lengthening the surveillance intervals for the smallest AAAs) did not bring the ICER below 30,000 (32,522) per QALY gained when considered either singly or in combination. Conclusion - The current UK cost-effectiveness criteria for a population-based AAA screening programme in women are not currently met.

J540,2019,Conservative management following closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder,"- Background Acute anterior shoulder dislocation, which is the most common type of dislocation, usually results from an injury. Subsequently, the shoulder is less stable and is more susceptible to reÃ¢â‚¬Âdislocation or recurrent instability (e.g. subluxation), especially in active young adults. After closed reduction, most of these injuries are treated with immobilisation of the injured arm in a sling or brace for a few weeks, followed by exercises. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006 and last updated in 2014. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions after closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder. These might include immobilisation, rehabilitative interventions or both. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro and trial registries. We also searched conference proceedings and reference lists of included studies. Date of last search: May 2018. Selection criteria We included randomised or quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomised controlled trials comparing conservative interventions with no treatment, a different intervention or a variant of the intervention (e.g. a different duration) for treating people after closed reduction of a primary traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation. Inclusion was regardless of age, sex or mechanism of injury. Primary outcomes were reÃ¢â‚¬Âdislocation, patientÃ¢â‚¬Âreported shoulder instability measures and return to preÃ¢â‚¬Âinjury activities. Secondary outcomes included participant satisfaction, healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life, any instability and adverse events. Data collection and analysis Both review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. We pooled results of comparable groups of studies. We assessed risk of bias with the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and the quality of the evidence with the GRADE approach. Main results We included seven trials (six randomised controlled trials and one quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomised controlled trial) with 704 participants; three of these trials (234 participants) are new to this update. The mean age across the trials was 29 years (range 12 to 90 years), and 82% of the participants were male. All trials compared immobilisation in external rotation (with or without an additional abduction component) versus internal rotation (the traditional method) following closed reduction. No trial evaluated any other interventions or comparisons, such as rehabilitation. All trials provided data for a followÃ¢â‚¬Âup of one year or longer; the commonest length was two years or longer. All trials were at some risk of bias, commonly performance and detection biases given the lack of blinding. Two trials were at high risk of selection bias and some trials were affected by attrition bias for some outcomes. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes. We are uncertain whether immobilisation in external rotation makes a difference to the risk of reÃ¢â‚¬Âdislocation after 12 months' or longer followÃ¢â‚¬Âup compared with immobilisation in internal rotation (55/245 versus 73/243; risk ratio (RR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 1.19; 488 participants; 6 studies; IÃ‚Â² = 61%; very low certainty evidence). In a moderateÃ¢â‚¬Ârisk population with an illustrative risk of 312 per 1000 people experiencing a dislocation in the internal rotation group, this equates to 103 fewer (95% CI 194 fewer to 60 more) reÃ¢â‚¬Âdislocations after immobilisation in external rotation. Thus this result covers the possibility of a benefit for each intervention. Individually, the four studies (380 participants) reporting on validated patientÃ¢â‚¬Âreported outcome measures for shoulder instability at a minimum of 12 months' followÃ¢â‚¬Âup found no evidence of a clinically important difference between the two interventions. We are uncertain of the relative effects of the two methods of immobilisat on on resumption of preÃ¢â‚¬Âinjury activities or sports. One study (169 participants) found no evidence of a difference between interventions in the return to preÃ¢â‚¬Âinjury activity of the affected arm. Two studies (135 participants) found greater return to sports in the external rotation group in a subgroup of participants who had sustained their injury during sports activities. None of the trials reported on participant satisfaction or healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between the two interventions in the number of participants experiencing instability, defined as either reÃ¢â‚¬Âdislocation or subluxation (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.14; 395 participants, 3 studies; very low certainty evidence). Data on adverse events were collected only in an ad hoc way in the seven studies. Reported transient and resolved adverse events"" were nine cases of shoulder stiffness or rigidity in the external rotation group and two cases of axillary rash in the internal rotation group. There were three ""important"" adverse events: hyperaesthesia and moderate hand pain; eighth cervical dermatome paraesthesia; and major movement restriction between 6 and 12 months. It was unclear to what extent these three events could be attributed to the treatment. Authors' conclusions The available evidence from randomised trials is limited to that comparing immobilisation in external versus internal rotation. Overall, the evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions about whether immobilisation in external rotation confers any benefit over immobilisation in internal rotation. Considering that there are several unpublished and ongoing trials evaluating immobilisation in external versus internal rotation, the main priority for research on this question consists of the publication of completed trials and the completion and publication of ongoing trials. Meanwhile, evaluation of other interventions, including rehabilitation, is warranted. There is a need for sufficiently large, goodÃ¢â‚¬Âquality, wellÃ¢â‚¬Âreported randomised controlled trials with longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. Future research should aim to determine the optimal immobilisation duration, precise indications for immobilisation, optimal rehabilitation interventions, and the acceptability of these different interventions. Plain language summary NonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical management after nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical repositioning of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder Background Acute anterior shoulder dislocation is an injury in which the top end of the upper arm bone is pushed out of the joint socket in a forward direction. Afterwards, the shoulder is less stable, and prone to either partial or complete reÃ¢â‚¬Âdislocation, especially in active young adults. Initial treatment involves putting the joint back in place. This is called Ã¢â‚¬Ëœclosed reductionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ when it is done without surgery. Subsequent treatment is often conservative (nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical) and usually involves a period of immobilisation of the injured arm in a sling or brace, followed by exercises. Review question What are the benefits and harms of different conservative interventions for treating people after closed reduction of a primary traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation? This is an update of a review that was first published in 2006 and last updated in 2014. We reviewed the evidence from clinical studies comparing any conservative intervention (e.g. immobilisation, rehabilitation) versus no treatment or a different intervention, or comparing different variants of an intervention (e.g. different duration). The primary outcomes of interest were reÃ¢â‚¬Âdislocation, patientÃ¢â‚¬Âreported shoulder instability measures (usually questionnaires) and return to preÃ¢â‚¬Âinjury activities. Further outcomes of interest included patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ satisfaction with the intervention, healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life and adverse events. Search date We conducted the searches of healthcare literature for this review in May 2018. Study characteristics We identified three new relevant studies in this update. In total, this review now includes seven studies with 704 participants. Most of the participants (82%) were male; the average age across the studies was 29 years (range 12 to 90 years). All of the studies investigated just one comparison: immobilisation in external rotation (when the arm is orientated outwards with the forearm away from the chest) versus immobilisation in internal rotation (the usual sling position, where the arm rests against the chest) following closed reduction. Participants were followed over different lengths of time; the most common duration was two years or longer. Key results We are uncertain whether immobilisation in external rotation makes a difference to the risk of reÃ¢â‚¬Âdislocation at oneÃ¢â‚¬Âyear or more followÃ¢â‚¬Âup compared with immobilisation in internal rotation. None of the four studies reporting on patientÃ¢â‚¬Âreported outcome measures for shoulder instability at a minimum of oneÃ¢â‚¬Âyear followÃ¢â‚¬Âup found evidence of any important difference between the two interventions. We are uncertain of the relative effects of the two methods of immobilisation on resumption of preÃ¢â‚¬Âinjury activities or sports. One study found no evidence of a difference between interventions in the return to preÃ¢â‚¬Âinjury activity of the affected arm. Two other studies found greater return to sports in the external rotation group in a small group of participants who had sustained their injury during sports activities. None of the trials reported on participant satisfaction or healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life. We are uncertain whether there is a difference between the two interventions in the number of participants experiencing instability, defined as either reÃ¢â‚¬Âdislocation or subluxation (a partial dislocation). The reporting of adverse events (complications) was unsatisfactory. There were reports of nine cases of shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm shoulder stiffness in the external rotation group and two cases of underÃ¢â‚¬Âarm rash in the internal fixation group. There were three more serious adverse events: abnormal sensitivity and hand pain; abnormal sensation such as tingling in the little finger and along to the elbow; and major movement restriction. It was unclear to what extent these three adverse events could be attributed to the treatment. Certainty of the evidence We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for all outcomes. This was mainly because there were not enough data and we were unsure how reliable the results were from the individual studies. Thus we are uncertain about the estimates of effect. Conclusions Overall, the current evidence is insufficient to inform the choice of immobilisation in external versus internal rotation. There is no evidence to inform on any other conservative interventions following closed reduction of traumatic anterior dislocation of the shoulder.""",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Study involves post-reduction care likely in community health settings.,TRUE,"Cochrane Review, peer-reviewed article",Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative study with clinical and PRO outcomes.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['clinical', 'pro', 'safety']",0.9
J541,2019,Surgical treatments for women with stress urinary incontinence: the ESTER systematic review and economic evaluation,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: Urinary incontinence in women is a distressing condition that restricts quality of life and results in a large economic burden to both the NHS and women themselves.
<b>OBJECTIVE</b>: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women and explore women's preferences.
<b>DESIGN</b>: An evidence synthesis, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and an economic decision model, with a value-of-information (VOI) analysis. Nine surgical interventions were compared. Previous Cochrane reviews for each were identified and updated to include additional studies. Systematic review methods were applied. The outcomes of interest were 'cure' and 'improvement'. Both a pairwise and a network meta-analysis (NMA) were conducted for all available surgical comparisons. A DCE was undertaken to assess the preferences of women for treatment outcomes. An economic model assessed the cost-effectiveness of alternative surgeries and a VOI analysis was undertaken.
<b>RESULTS</b>: Data from 175 studies were included in the effectiveness review. The majority of included studies were rated as being at high or unclear risk of bias across all risk-of-bias domains. The NMA, which included 120 studies that reported data on 'cure' or 'improvement', showed that retropubic mid-urethral sling (MUS), transobturator MUS, traditional sling and open colposuspension were more effective than other surgical procedures for both primary outcomes. The results for other interventions were variable. In general, rate of tape and mesh exposure was higher after transobturator MUS than after retropubic MUS or single-incision sling, whereas the rate of tape or mesh erosion/extrusion was similar between transobturator MUS and retropubic MUS. The results of the DCE, in which 789 women completed an anonymous online questionnaire, indicate that women tend to prefer surgical treatments associated with no pain or mild chronic pain and shorter length of hospital stay as well as those treatments that have a smaller risk for urinary symptoms to reoccur after surgery. The cost-effectiveness results suggest that, over a lifetime, retropubic MUS is, on average, the least costly and most effective surgery. However, the high level of uncertainty makes robust estimates difficult to ascertain. The VOI analysis highlighted that further research around the incidence rates of complications would be of most value.
<b>LIMITATIONS</b>: Overall, the quality of the clinical evidence was low, with limited data available for the assessment of complications. Furthermore, there is a lack of robust evidence and significant uncertainty around some parameters in the economic modelling.
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive assessment of published evidence for the treatment of SUI. There is some evidence that retropubic MUS, transobturator MUS and traditional sling are effective in the short to medium term and that retropubic MUS is cost-effective in the medium to long term. The VOI analysis highlights the value of further research to reduce the uncertainty around the incidence rates of complications. There is a need to obtain robust clinical data in future work, particularly around long-term complication rates.

J544,2019,PRIMEtime CE: a multistate life table model for estimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions affecting diet and physical activity,"BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases are the leading cause of death in England, and poor diet and physical inactivity are two of the principle behavioural risk factors. In the context of increasingly constrained financial resources, decision makers in England need to be able to compare the potential costs and health outcomes of different public health policies aimed at improving these risk factors in order to know where to invest so that they can maximise population health. This paper describes PRIMEtime CE, a multistate life table cost-effectiveness model that can directly compare interventions affecting multiple disease outcomes. METHOD(S): The multistate life table model, PRIMEtime Cost Effectiveness (PRIMEtime CE), is developed from the Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl (PRIME) and the PRIMEtime model. PRIMEtime CE uses routinely available data to estimate how changing diet and physical activity in England affects morbidity and mortality from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, liver disease, and cancers either directly or via raised blood pressure, cholesterol, and body weight. RESULT(S): Model outcomes are change in quality adjusted life years, and change in English National Health Service and social care costs.

J545,2019,"Estimating the cost-effectiveness of salt reformulation and increasing access to leisure centres in England, with PRIMEtime CE model validation using the AdViSHE tool","BACKGROUND: PRIMEtime CE is a multistate life table model that can directly compare the cost effectiveness of public health interventions affecting diet and physical activity levels, helping to inform decisions about how to spend finite resources. This paper estimates the costs and health outcomes in England of two scenarios: reformulating salt and expanding subsidised access to leisure centres. The results are used to help validate PRIMEtime CE, following the steps outlined in the Assessment of the Validation Status of Health-Economic decision models (AdViSHE) tool. METHOD(S): The PRIMEtime CE model estimates the difference in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and difference in NHS and social care costs of modelled interventions compared with doing nothing. The salt reformulation scenario models how salt consumption would change if food producers met the 2017 UK Food Standards Agency salt reformulation targets. The leisure centre scenario models change in physical activity levels if the Birmingham Be Active scheme (where swimming pools and gym access is free to residents during defined periods) was rolled out across England. The AdViSHE tool was developed by health economic modellers and divides model validation into five parts: validation of the conceptual model, input data validation, validation of computerised model, operational validation, and other validation techniques. PRIMEtime CE is discussed in relation to each part. RESULT(S): Salt reformulation was dominant compared with doing nothing, and had a 10-year return on investment of 1.44 (0.50 to 2.94) for every 1 spent. By contrast, over 10 years the Be Active expansion would cost 727,000 (514,000 to 1,064,000) per QALY. PRIMEtime CE has good face validity of its conceptual model and has robust input data.

J547,2019,"Individualised screening for diabetic retinopathy: The ISDR study-a randomised controlled trial of safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness","Background: Varying the intervals in retinopathy screening informed by personal risk offers reallocation of resources to better target high risk groups and address the increasing prevalence of diabetes. However, safety data especially on extended intervals is minimal. Aim(s): To evaluate the safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness (CE) of individualized variable-interval risk-based screening in a population setting compared to usual care. Method(s): Masked 2 arm, parallel assignment, equivalence RCT (largest to date in screening) with independent trials unit monitoring in people with diabetes aged >=12 years attending screening in a single English program. Randomization was 1:1 to individualized screening (active group; 6, 12 or 24 months for high, medium and low risk) determined by a risk calculation engine using real-time local demographic, retinal and clinical data, compared with annual screening (control). CE analysis measuring NHS and societal costs took a 2-year time horizon. Finding(s): 4534 participants entered the study-after withdrawals/loss to follow-up: active 2097; control 2224. Attendance rates at first follow-up visit (primary outcome, safety) were equivalent (per protocol analysis, 5% margin): active 83.6% control 84.7% (difference 1.0, 90% CI-0.8, 2.9). STDR detection rates were non-inferior (1.5% margin): active 1.43% control 1.71% (difference-0.28, CI-0.93, 0.36). Quality of life (EQ5D5L, HUI3) was not significantly different between the groups. Incremental cost saving per person was 18.75 (NHS cost) rising to 49.96 with societal costs. A 39.3% reduction in number of appointments was seen.

J549,2019,Assessing the early impact of enhanced NHS england (NHSE) funding on footcare services,"Background: A key aim of the National Diabetes Treatment and Care Programme is to improve footcare services. In Sheffield, this investment was used primarily to expand the foot protection team (FPT) and in prevention strategies. Aim(s): To assess if there has been a benefit for patients and if the spending has been cost-effective. Method(s): Ulcer severity in patients presenting to the Multi-Disciplinary Foot Team (MDFT) (SINBAD score >3 = severe, <3 = mild) was tracked between 2013 and 2018, to determine whether the proportion of severe ulcers had declined. Cost calculations were based on the 'Economic Case for Change' paper (Marion Kerr, 2017); weekly cost of a mild ulcer-77, severe ulcer-359. Result(s): The percentage of ulcers presenting as severe from 2013-2017 (prior to additional investment) was 27%, 32%, 43%, 47% and 46% respectively. In 2018, to date, this has fallen to 36%. Our mean healing time for a mild ulcer is 12.6 weeks (974) vs a severe ulcer at 16.3 weeks (5,847). This represents an approximate reduction in the costs of managing foot ulcers from 326,000/100 patients (pre-investment) to 273,000/100 patients (post-investment), a saving of 53,000/100 patients. Approximately 500 patients with new ulcers are seen by our MDFT each year, giving a total estimated saving of 268,000. If the percentage of severe ulcers returned to the baseline of 2013 (27%), savings would total around 487,000/100 patients. Conclusion(s): These data show that, within a very short timescale, the enhanced NHSE funding and added investment in prevention strategies reduced severe ulcers, giving patients' better quality of life, shorter healing times, and is cost-effective.",TRUE,"Study conducted in UK setting, references NHS England and Sheffield.",TRUE,Study occurs in NHS settings with footcare services.,TRUE,Appears to be a peer-reviewed study.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Pre/post comparison with cost and clinical outcomes.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['cost', 'clinical', 'pro']",0.95
J551,2019,Cost effectiveness of letermovir as prophylaxis of clinically significant cytomegalovirus reactivation and disease in adult CMV-seropositive allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant: A Scottish payer perspective,"Background: Data from a recent phase III clinical trial has demonstrated the efficacy of letermovir as prophylaxis against CMV reactivation in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT). The objective of this cost-effectiveness analysis is to evaluate the clinical and economic value of letermovir when compared to pre-emptive treatment from the payer perspective in Scotland. Method(s): A decision-analytic model evaluated total costs and lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALY's) from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and social work in Scotland. Efficacy data, including rates of preemptive therapy for CMV infection, CMV disease, rehospitalization, mortality, and quality of life were incorporated from clinical trial data at 24 weeks posttransplant. The primary endpoint of the trial was clinically significant CMV-infection at week 24 post-transplant. Costs of preemptive treatment, CMV disease, and other trial outcomes were obtained from published sources. Life-years during the first 24 weeks were estimated from the mortality observed in the clinical trial. Life-years post 24 weeks were estimated for the week 24 survivors by applying a relative risk of death for HSCT to the general mortality risk from the life tables for Scotland (2014-16). Utility values were applied based on EQ-5D data collected in the clinical trial and longer-term data from published sources. The annual cost to treat 1-year survivors was based on a proportion of patients receiving 2 years of immunosuppressive agent treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease (onset 100 days after transplant). Sensitivity analysis explored the impact of including data from the extended follow-up period, where various endpoints were collected through 48 weeks post-transplant. The model used an annual discount rate of 3.5%. Result(s): In the base-case analysis, letermovir reduced the number CMV infections requiring pre-emptive treatment vs standard of care (SoC) (20.0% vs 49.3%) at 24 weeks posttransplant. Prophylaxis with letermovir resulted in lower allcause mortality at week 24 in comparison to SoC (10.2% vs. 15.9%), and a mean increase in life-years (+0.46), QALY's (+0.41) and total costs up to week 24 post-HSCT per patient. This resulted in an incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) of 12,659 per QALY gained. The sensitivity analysis using data from 48 weeks posttransplant did not have a significant effect on the results. Results of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that letermovir was cost effective in 77.4% of iterations at 20,000 per QALY gained and 87.6% of iterations at 30,000 per QALY gained. Conclusion(s): The results of this model would suggest that the prophylaxis use of letermovir is a cost-effective treatment strategy at commonly accepted ICER thresholds. The model inputs with a greatest impact on the results were a reduction in the rate of mortality, increasing the age of patients treated with letermovir, and an increase in the cost of prophylaxis for letermovir.",TRUE,Study conducted from a Scottish payer perspective and NHS Scotland.,TRUE,Study evaluates NHS cost-effectiveness for CMV prophylaxis in transplant patients.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed cost-effectiveness analysis article.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative cost-effectiveness analysis with primary outcomes on cost and clinical impact.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,"['cost', 'qaly', 'clinical', 'pro']",0.95
J552,2019,PharmacyÃ¢â‚¬Âbased management for depression in adults,"- Background It is common for people not to take antidepressant medication as prescribed, with around 50% of people likely to prematurely discontinue taking their medication after six months. Community pharmacists may be well placed to have a role in antidepressant management because of their unique pharmacotherapeutic knowledge and ease of access for people. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to offer proactive interventions to people with depression or depressive symptoms. However, the effectiveness and acceptability of existing pharmacistÃ¢â‚¬Âbased interventions is not yet well understood. The degree to which a pharmacyÃ¢â‚¬Âbased management approach might be beneficial, acceptable to people, and effective as part of the overall management for those with depression is, to date, unclear. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) will help answer these questions and add important knowledge to the currently sparse evidence base. Objectives To examine the effects of pharmacyÃ¢â‚¬Âbased management interventions compared with active control (e.g. patient information materials or any other active intervention delivered by someone other than the pharmacist or the pharmacy team), waiting list, or treatment as usual (e.g. standard pharmacist advice or antidepressant education, signposting to support available in primary care services, brief medication counselling, and/or (selfÃ¢â‚¬Â)monitoring of medication adherence offered by a healthcare professional outside the pharmacy team) at improving depression outcomes in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDÃ¢â‚¬ÂCTR) to June 2016; the Cochrane Library (Issue 11, 2018); and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to December 2018. We searched theses and dissertation databases and international trial registers for unpublished/ongoing trials. We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches. Selection criteria We included all RCTs and clusterÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCTs where a pharmacyÃ¢â‚¬Âbased intervention was compared with treatment as usual, waiting list, or an alternative intervention in the management of depression in adults over 16 years of age. Eligible studies had to report at least one of the following outcomes at any time point: depression symptom change, acceptability of the intervention, diagnosis of depression, nonÃ¢â‚¬Âadherence to medication, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently, and in duplicate, conducted all stages of study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment (including GRADE). We discussed disagreements within the team until we reached consensus. Where data did not allow metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalyses, we synthesised results narratively. Main results Twelve studies (2215 participants) met the inclusion criteria and compared pharmacyÃ¢â‚¬Âbased management with treatment as usual. Two studies (291 participants) also included an active control (both used patient information leaflets providing information about the prescribed antidepressant). Neither of these studies reported depression symptom change. A narrative synthesis of results on acceptability of the intervention was inconclusive, with one study reporting better acceptability of pharmacyÃ¢â‚¬Âbased management and the other better acceptability of the active control. One study reported that participants in the pharmacyÃ¢â‚¬Âbased management group had better medication adherence than the control participants. One study reported adverse events with no difference between groups. The studies reported no other outcomes. MetaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalyses comparing pharmacyÃ¢â‚¬Âbased management with treatment as usual showed no evidence of a difference in the effect of the intervention on depression symptom change (dichotomous data; improvement in symptoms yes/no: risk ratio (RR), 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 4 RCTs, 475 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence; continuous data: standard mean difference (SMD) Ã¢â‚¬Â0.04, 95%",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Pharmacy-based management implies community health setting.,TRUE,"Systematic review of RCTs, likely peer-reviewed.",Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,RCTs with comparators and primary outcomes on impact.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,"['clinical', 'pro', 'safety']",0.9

The heterogeneity of patients referred with suspected neutropenic sepsis"" has led to strategies being developed to risk-stratify patients and identify those with a low risk of septic complications that could be managed in the outpatient setting, such as The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer score (MASCC). Outcomes for patients referred with suspected neutropenic sepsis were assessed before and after use of MASCC guided early-supported discharge. 50/123 (41%) patients over 24 months were eligible for early-supported discharge. 26/50 patients had same-day discharge, 14 had overnight admission, 8 stayed 2 nights and 2 stayed 3 nights. Patients received on average 2 follow-up telephone consultations. There were 5 readmissions (10%) and no adverse events.

J555,2019,Should we all be looking for marginal gains in endoscopy efficiency?,"Introduction Demand for endoscopy in the UK has doubled in the last 5 years. In 2017, 64% of units failed to meet suspected cancer targets despite 66% of units having weekend lists and 27% outsourcing to external providers1. UCL Cancer Collaborative (UCLCC) data showed demand can be met by improving efficiency. This is important in a resource-limited setting. Our Quality Improvement (QI) Project aimed to improve efficiency by improving turnaround time, non-attendance and on-the-day cancellations. Methods The Endoscopy QI fellow, endoscopy unit manager and Gastroenterology service manager participated in the UCLCC Improvement Programme, and utilised QI methodology. We collected data from electronic patient records and scheduling system. At baseline, we identified that underutilisation of lists was multifactorial. We introduced a turnaround nurse role to consent patients. Healthcare assistants (HCAS) and nurses were trained in cannulation. As poor bowel preparation contributed to cancellations, we introduced telephone pre-assessment to educate patients. Finally, the administrative team sent text reminders before appointments. Results At baseline, our unit performed an average of 7.9 points per list, out of a planned 10. On average, 28.5 patients per month had procedures cancelled on the day due to poor bowel prep or inadequate fasting. After the introduction of pre-assessment, it improved to 23.5 per month, saving 5 procedures which would have had to be rearranged. The average points performed improved to 9.3 points per list. The average DNA rate has improved from 9% to 7% after the introduction of text reminders. After the introduction of the turnaround nurse and HCA cannulation, turnaround time reduced from an average of 18 to 9 minutes between procedures. This could save 90 minutes over a 12-point list. Despite these improvements, only 41.6% of lists are booked for 1-2 points. Inadequate staffing numbers and late start times are contributing factors. A start time audit showed that only 5 out of 27 lists in a week started within 10 minutes of supposed start times, a target for further cycles of this QI project. Conclusions Multiple small improvements in efficiency can achieve significant impact on productivity. Interventions focused on turnaround time can reduce underuse of list time. Patient-centred approaches to procedural preparation may reduce squandered appointments. Sustainability of these improvements is difficult to assess in the short term but will be promoted by the continuing QI fellow role and implementation of endoscopy QI champions from the administrative and nursing team.",TRUE,"Study conducted in the UK, references NHS and UK-specific data.",TRUE,Study occurs in an NHS endoscopy unit.,TRUE,"Unclear publication type, flagged for review",Unknown,0.7,TRUE,Pre/post comparison with numeric deltas and impact outcomes.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['utilization', 'time']",0.9
J556,2019,Low Back and Radicular Pain Including Symptomatic Spinal Stenosis,"Back pain is the largest single cause of disability in the UK, with lower back pain alone accounting for 11% of the total disability of the UK population. Currently there is enormous geographical variation in the pathways, costs and outcomes of patients with back pain. Despite existing evidence there are a significant number of treatments with low clinical value still in use. The NHS England Trauma Programme of Care Board selected Low Back Pain and Radicular Pain as a pathfinder project in 2013. A clinical group of 30 stakeholder representatives worked collaboratively to produce an agreed, seamless pathway, extending from first contact in primary care through to secondary care and specialist services. This pathway was updated in 2017 following the publication of NICE NG59 and is endorsed in the 2019 GIRFT report. The National Back and Radicular Pain Pathway (NBRPP) is recognised as the commissioning pathway of choice for CCG's. Implementation of the NBRPP is currently being driven through Right Care and GIRFT. National Back and Radicular Pain Pathway. Where implemented, evaluation of the pathway provides evidence that the NBRPP results in substantial cost saving through reducing; admissions for back pain (with or without radicular pain), therapeutic injections for back pain, readmissions and spinal fusions for back pain.

J557,2019,Pns408 How Is the English Nhs Prescription Drugs Budget Spent,"Objectives: In Financial Year (FY) 2018/19, NHS England (NHSE) spent 7.9 billion on prescription drugs prescribed by GPs to their patients. This is 2.7% less than FY 2017/18. This study investigated drivers of this trend at regional and drug-class levels on a risk-adjusted basis and projected the results over a five year time period. Method(s): Publicly available data was used. Prescription drug and population data published by the NHS were used to derive the per person per month costs. The prescription drug risk-adjustment factors were based on those used in the NHS funding allocation formula. Prescription drug cost and activity trends were analysed at a drug-class (BNF chapter) and regional level. Regions were defined by sustainability and transformation plan (STP) area. Risk-adjustment helped determine what cost we would 'expect' based on each STP's risk profile compared to the English average. Costs were projected over a five-year period under various scenarios, using expected changes in population size and structure published by the NHS. Result(s): The reduction in expenditure is driven by a combination of lower average costs (3.83% decrease) and lower levels of activity (0.92% decrease). These decreases in total cost are slightly offset by the 1.19% increase in the English population size. The research highlights particular BNF chapters and STP regions that are driving these trends as well as how STP regions' experience compares to the English average on a risk-adjusted basis. The projection model shows that prescription drug costs can be expected to decrease by 3.6% p.a. over the next five years if historical trends persist. Conclusion(s): The insights provided by this research can help stakeholders with experience analysis and planning by identifying cost and activity drivers on a population risk-adjusted basis as well as having a view of how demand may develop over the projection period.

J558,2019,Conservative interventions for treating functional daytime urinary incontinence in children,"- Background In children, functional daytime urinary incontinence is the term used to describe any leakage of urine while awake that is not the result of a known underlying neurological or congenital anatomic cause (such as conditions or injuries that affect the nerves that control the bladder or problems with the way the urinary system is formed). It can result in practical difficulties for both the child and their family and can have detrimental effects on a childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wellÃ¢â‚¬Âbeing, education and social engagement. Objectives To assess the effects of conservative interventions for treating functional daytime urinary incontinence in children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains studies identified from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE InÃ¢â‚¬ÂProcess, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 11 September 2018). We also searched Chinese language bibliographic databases: Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang. No language restrictions were imposed. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomised, multiÃ¢â‚¬Âarm studies, crossÃ¢â‚¬Âover studies and clusterÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomised studies that included children aged between 5 and 18 years with functional daytime urinary incontinence. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened records and determined the eligibility of studies for inclusion according to predefined criteria. Where data from the study were not provided, we contacted the study authors to request further information. Two review authors assessed risk of bias and processed included study data as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Where metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis was possible, we applied randomÃ¢â‚¬Âeffects metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis using the MantelÃ¢â‚¬ÂHaenszel method for dichotomous outcomes. Main results The review included 27 RCTs involving 1803 children. Of these, six were multiÃ¢â‚¬Âarm and one was also a crossÃ¢â‚¬Âover study. Most studies were small, with numbers randomised ranging from 16 to 202. A total of 19 studies were at high risk of bias for at least one domain. Few studies reported data suitable for pooling due to heterogeneity in interventions, outcomes and measurements. Individual conservative interventions (lifestyle, behavioural or physical) versus no treatment Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) versus sham (placebo) TENS. M ore children receiving active TENS may achieve continence (risk ratio (RR) 4.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68 to 14.21; 3 studies; n = 93; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). One individual conservative intervention versus another individual or combined conservative intervention Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with urotherapy versus urotherapy alone. We are uncertain whether more children receiving PFMT with urotherapy achieve continence (RR 2.36, 95% CI 0.65 to 8.53, 95% CI 25 to 100; 3 studies; n = 91; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Voiding education with uroflowmetry feedback and urotherapy versus urotherapy alone. Slightly more children receiving voiding education with uroflow feedback and urotherapy may achieve continence (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.45; 3 studies; n = 151; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Urotherapy with timer watch versus urotherapy alone. We are uncertain whether urotherapy plus timer watch increases the number of children achieving continence compared to urotherapy alone (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.80; 1 study; n = 58; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Combined conservative interventions versus other combined conservative interventions TENS and standard urotherapy versus PFMT with electromyographic biofeedback and standard urotherapy. We are uncertain whether there is any evidence of a difference between treatment groups in the proportions of children achieving continence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.68; 1 study; n = 78; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). PFMT with electr myography biofeedback and standard urotherapy versus PFMT without feedback but with standard urotherapy. We are uncertain whether there is any evidence of a difference between treatment groups in the proportions of children achieving continence (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.52; 1 study; n = 41; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Individual conservative interventions versus nonÃ¢â‚¬Âconservative interventions (pharmacological or invasive, combined or not with any conservative interventions) PFMT versus anticholinergics. We are uncertain whether more children receiving PFMT than anticholinergics achieve continence (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.15; equivalent to an increase from 33 to 64 per 100 children; 2 studies; n = 86; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). TENS versus anticholinergics. We are uncertain whether there was any evidence of a difference between treatment groups in the proportions of children achieving continence (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.05 to 12.50; 2 studies; n = 72; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Combined conservative interventions versus nonÃ¢â‚¬Âconservative interventions (pharmacological or invasive, combined or not with any conservative interventions) Voiding education with uroflowmetry feedback versus anticholinergics. We are uncertain whether there was any evidence of a difference between treatment groups in the proportion of children achieving continence (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.78; 1 study; n = 64; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions The review found little reliable evidence that can help affected children, their carers and the clinicians working with them to make evidenceÃ¢â‚¬Âbased treatment decisions. In this scenario, the clinical experience of individual clinicians and the support of carers may be the most valuable resources. More wellÃ¢â‚¬Âdesigned research, with wellÃ¢â‚¬Âdefined interventions and consistent outcome measurement, is needed. Plain language summary Conservative (nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmaceutical and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical) treatments for children who have daytime urinary incontinence Background Many children continue to have daytime wetting accidents (urinary incontinence) long after most become dry, some into teenage years. When there is no known cause, it is referred to as functional daytime urinary incontinence. Daytime wetting can be a practical problem for the child and their carers, leading to additional laundry, expenses on absorbent pads or underwear, wet or stained furnishings and difficulties attending school or travelling. It can also lead to emotional stress, poor school attendance and performance, difficulties with social activities and making friends, and even depression and behaviour problems. Finding an effective treatment can improve the quality of life of children and their carers. Review question Children, their carers, doctors and nurses may want to avoid treatments that involve drugs or surgery, at least until they have tried treatments that do not involve these. In this review researchers brought together the results of studies conducted around the world to combine the evidence and assess which treatment(s) are most effective for managing daytime urinary incontinence in children. How upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate is this review? The evidence is current to 11 September 2018. Study characteristics and funding sources The review identified 27 studies involving 1803 children. Twelve studies declared funding from outside sources. One of these was funded by Astellas Pharma, while another study was provided with special batches of placebo and medication free of charge, as well as materials for pad tests free of charge from another company. Certainty of evidence Cochrane Reviews assess the 'certainty' or reliability of the evidence using standardised methods that consider the way studies were designed, conducted and reported, differences between studies or populations, and the combined results of studies. Most of the studies identified for this review were small and many were poorly designed and not reported clearly. Most of the evidence was considered to be of very low certainty, meaning that little can be sa d with any certainty about the effectiveness of treatments. Key results Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may be more effective than no treatment for ending or reducing daytime wetting. We are uncertain whether urotherapy (behavioural programmes in which children Ã¢â‚¬Â and sometimes carers Ã¢â‚¬Â are taught about how the bladder works, proper toileting postures and methods, scheduled toileting, and planning what and how much to drink) is more effective when supplemented with PFMT, voiding education with feedback, or watches with alarms set to remind children when to go to the toilet. We are uncertain whether feedback that shows children how their muscles are working or how their bladder is emptying improves the effectiveness of TENS with urotherapy compared to PFMT plus feedback and urotherapy. We are also uncertain whether PFMT and urotherapy plus feedback improves the effectiveness of PFMT and urotherapy alone. We are uncertain whether pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) or TENS are more effective than anticholinergics (drugs that can reduce signals from the brain that cause the bladder to contract and empty). We are uncertain whether voiding education plus uroflowmetry (a test to measure the volume of urine) and feedback increases the number of continent children compared to anticholinergics. No serious adverse events were reported that were considered to be related to study treatments. Most nonÃ¢â‚¬Âserious adverse events and side effects were mild or moderate in severity and were in children receiving pharmaceutical interventions. These included common pharmaceutical side effects such as nausea, abdominal pain, dry mouth, drowsiness and headache. Authors' conclusions There is a lack of goodÃ¢â‚¬Âquality research evidence that can help children, their carers and doctors and nurses to make decisions about treatments. More wellÃ¢â‚¬Âdesigned research may provide much needed evidence about the effectiveness of promising interventions in children with daytime urinary incontinence, such as TENS, PFMT and timers on watches (or mobile phones) to remind children about toileting schedules. However, it is hoped that this review will draw attention to the need for research into effective treatments for daytime wetting in children.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Study likely in community health settings due to urotherapy and interventions for children.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article from Cochrane Review.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative RCTs with clinical outcomes,TRUE,Placebo,TRUE,['clinical'],0.9
J561,2019,Dietary interventions for adult cancer survivors,"- Background International dietary recommendations include guidance on healthy eating and weight management for people who have survived cancer; however dietary interventions are not provided routinely for people living beyond cancer. Objectives To assess the effects of dietary interventions for adult cancer survivors on morbidity and mortality, changes in dietary behaviour, body composition, healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life, and clinical measurements. Search methods We ran searches on 18 September 2019 and searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via Ovid; Embase via Ovid; the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). We searched other resources including reference lists of retrieved articles, other reviews on the topic, the International Trials Registry for ongoing trials, metaRegister, Physicians Data Query, and appropriate websites for ongoing trials. We searched conference abstracts and WorldCat for dissertations. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited people following a cancer diagnosis. The intervention was any dietary advice provided by any method including group sessions, telephone instruction, written materials, or a webÃ¢â‚¬Âbased approach. We included comparisons that could be usual care or written information, and outcomes measured included overall survival, morbidities, secondary malignancies, dietary changes, anthropometry, quality of life (QoL), and biochemistry. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Two people independently assessed titles and fullÃ¢â‚¬Âtext articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. For analysis, we used a randomÃ¢â‚¬Âeffects statistical model for all metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalyses, and the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence, considering limitations, indirectness, inconsistencies, imprecision, and bias. Main results We included 25 RCTs involving 7259 participants including 977 (13.5%) men and 6282 (86.5%) women. Mean age reported ranged from 52.6 to 71 years, and range of age of included participants was 23 to 85 years. The trials reported 27 comparisons and included participants who had survived breast cancer (17 trials), colorectal cancer (2 trials), gynaecological cancer (1 trial), and cancer at mixed sites (5 trials). For overall survival, dietary intervention and control groups showed little or no difference in risk of mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.23; 1 study; 3107 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). For secondary malignancies, dietary interventions versus control trials reported little or no difference (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.15; 1 study; 3107 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). CoÃ¢â‚¬Âmorbidities were not measured in any included trials. Subsequent outcomes reported after 12 months found that dietary interventions versus control probably make little or no difference in energy intake at 12 months (mean difference (MD) Ã¢â‚¬Â59.13 kcal, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â159.05 to 37.79; 5 studies; 3283 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Dietary interventions versus control probably led to slight increases in fruit and vegetable servings (MD 0.41 servings, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.71; 5 studies; 834 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); mixed results for fibre intake overall (MD 5.12 g, 95% CI 0.66 to 10.9; 2 studies; 3127 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); and likely improvement in Diet Quality Index (MD 3.46, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.38; 747 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). For anthropometry, dietary intervention versus control probably led to a slightly decreased body mass index (BMI) (MD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.79 kg/mÃ‚Â², 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â1.50 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.07; 4 studies; 777 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Dietary interventions versus control probably had little or no effect on waistÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âhip ratio (MD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.01, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.04 to 0.02; 2 studies; 106 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). For QoL, there were mixed results; several different quality assessment tools were used and evidence was of low to very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty. No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Authors' conclusions Evidence demonstrated little effects of dietary interventions on overall mortality and secondary cancers. For comorbidities, no evidence was identified. For nutritional outcomes, there was probably little or no effect on energy intake, although probably a slight increase in fruit and vegetable intake and Diet Quality Index. Results were mixed for fibre. For anthropometry, there was probably a slight decrease in body mass index (BMI) but probably little or no effect on waistÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âhip ratio. For QoL, results were highly varied. Additional highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality research is needed to examine the effects of dietary interventions for different cancer sites, and to evaluate important outcomes including comorbidities and body composition. Evidence on new technologies used to deliver dietary interventions was limited. Plain language summary Dietary intake in people living beyond cancer Background Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Diet has been linked to cancer, and dietary guidelines are available for cancer prevention. People after cancer have been found to have higher rates of other conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other cancers. It is therefore sensible for people after cancer to look at changing their diet. It was important to undertake this review to assess the evidence on dietary advice for people who have survived cancer. Aim of the review Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ This review evaluates evidence on dietary interventions for people after cancer. Quality of evidence Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ The quality of evidence is generally low to very low. Most studies did not evaluate dietary interventions for key review outcomes, particularly mortality and morbidity. However, a few study outcomes with moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence focused on dietary intake and physical measurements. Included studies compared dietary interventions versus control or usual care. We pooled data from similar randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide a summary estimate of the effects of an intervention, and we judged how confident (certain) we were of these findings by using an established method (GRADE). Main findings Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ We identified 25 RCTs involving 27 different comparisons. For some outcomes, we found absence of evidence for dietary interventions. We found some evidence showing that dietary interventions probably did not modify energy intake; however, some evidence shows what is probably a slight increase in fruit and vegetable intake (moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence ) . Evidence on dietary fibre was mixed for different advice on weight reducing or healthy eating. Dietary interventions compared to control probably improved the Diet Quality Index (moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence ) . For physical measurements, we found a probable reduction in body mass index (BMI) with dietary interventions compared to controls (moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) but little evidence showing any change in waistÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âhip ratio (lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence ) . For quality of life (QoL), results were mixed due to the wide variety of tools used. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Available evidence shows that dietary interventions can be helpful in modifying fruit and vegetable servings and diet quality; modification of fibre intake was variable, and some benefits were seen for anthropometric measurements, including BMI. Most of the evidence is based on women with breast cancer, so more research is needed for patients with other cancers.

J566,2019,Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of delirium in critically ill adults,"- Background Although delirium is typically an acute reversible cognitive impairment, its presence is associated with devastating impact on both shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm and longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm outcomes for critically ill patients. Advances in our understanding of the negative impact of delirium on patient outcomes have prompted trials evaluating multiple pharmacological interventions. However, considerable uncertainty surrounds the relative benefits and safety of available pharmacological interventions for this population. Objectives Primary objective 1. To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions for treatment of delirium on duration of delirium in critically ill adults with confirmed or documented high risk of delirium Secondary objectives To assess the following: 1. effects of pharmacological interventions on deliriumÃ¢â‚¬Âfree and comaÃ¢â‚¬Âfree days; days with coma; delirium relapse; duration of mechanical ventilation; intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay; mortality; and longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm outcomes (e.g. cognitive; discharge disposition; healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life); and 2. the safety of such treatments for critically ill adult patients. Search methods We searched the following databases from their inception date to 21 March 2019: Ovid MEDLINEÃ‚Â®, Ovid MEDLINEÃ‚Â® InÃ¢â‚¬ÂProcess & Other NonÃ¢â‚¬ÂIndexed Citations, Embase Classic+Embase, and PsycINFO using the Ovid platform. We also searched the Cochrane Library on Wiley, the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) ( http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/ ), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science. We performed a grey literature search of relevant databases and websites using the resources listed in Grey Matters developed by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH). We also searched trial registries and abstracts from annual scientific critical care and delirium society meetings. Selection criteria We sought randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including quasiÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCTs, of any pharmacological (drug) for treatment of delirium in critically ill adults. The drug intervention was to be compared to another active drug treatment, placebo, or a nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacological intervention (e.g. mobilization). We did not apply any restrictions in terms of drug class, dose, route of administration, or duration of delirium or drug exposure. We defined critically ill patients as those treated in an ICU of any specialty (e.g. burn, cardiac, medical, surgical, trauma) or highÃ¢â‚¬Âdependency unit. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified studies from the search results; four review authors (in pairs) performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias independently. We performed data synthesis through pairwise metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis and network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis (NMA). Our hypothetical network structure was designed to be analysed at the drug class level and illustrated a network diagram of 'nodes' (i.e. drug classes) and 'edges' (i.e. comparisons between different drug classes from existing trials), thus describing a treatment network of all possible comparisons between drug classes. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence according to GRADE, as very low, low, moderate, or high. Main results We screened 7674 citations, from which 14 trials with 1844 participants met our inclusion criteria. Ten RCTs were placeboÃ¢â‚¬Âcontrolled, and four reported comparisons of different drugs. Drugs examined in these trials were the following: antipsychotics (n = 10), alpha 2 agonists (n = 3; all dexmedetomidine), statins (n = 2), opioids (n = 1; morphine), serotonin antagonists (n = 1; ondansetron), and cholinesterase (CHE) inhibitors (n = 1; rivastigmine). Only one of these trials consistently used nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacological interventions that are known to improve patient outcomes in both intervention and control groups. Eleven studies (n = 1153 participants) contributed to analysis of the primary outcome. Results of the NMA showed that the intervention with the smallest ratio of means (RoM) (i.e. most preferred) compared with placebo was the alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine (0.58; 95% credible interval (CrI) 0.26 to 1.27; surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) 0.895; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). In order of descending SUCRA values (best to worst), the next best interventions were atypical antipsychotics (RoM 0.80, 95% CrI 0.50 to 1.11; SUCRA 0.738; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence), opioids (RoM 0.88, 95% CrI 0.37 to 2.01; SUCRA 0.578; veryÃ¢â‚¬Âlow quality evidence), and typical antipsychotics (RoM 0.96, 95% CrI 0.64 to1.36; SUCRA 0.468; highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). The NMAs of multiple secondary outcomes revealed that only the alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine was associated with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (RoM 0.55, 95% CrI 0.34 to 0.89; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence), and the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with a longer ICU stay (RoM 2.19, 95% CrI 1.47 to 3.27; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or, when reported, were rare; pairÃ¢â‚¬Âwise analysis of QTc prolongation in seven studies did not show significant differences between antipsychotics, ondansetron, dexmedetomidine, and placebo. Authors' conclusions We identified trials of varying quality that examined six different drug classes for treatment of delirium in critically ill adults. We found evidence that the alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine may shorten delirium duration, although this small effect (compared with placebo) was seen in pairwise analyses based on a single study and was not seen in the NMA results. Alpha 2 agonists also ranked best for duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay, whereas the CHE inhibitor rivastigmine was associated with longer ICU stay. We found no evidence of a difference between placebo and any drug in terms of deliriumÃ¢â‚¬Âfree and comaÃ¢â‚¬Âfree days, days with coma, physical restraint use, length of stay, longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm cognitive outcomes, or mortality. No studies reported delirium relapse, resolution of symptoms, or quality of life. The ten ongoing studies and the six studies awaiting classification that we identified, once published and assessed, may alter the conclusions of the review. Plain language summary Medicines to treat delirium in critically ill adult patients Review question We reviewed the evidence from randomized controlled trials for the benefits and safety of all prescription medicines used to treat critically ill adult patients with delirium in the intensive care units (ICUs) of hospitals. Background Delirium is commonly associated with surgery, infection, or critical illness. It is experienced as newÃ¢â‚¬Âonset, generally shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm inability to think clearly. Patients with delirium shift between periods of clear thinking and periods of agitation and/or great sleepiness and confusion. Lack of sleep, pain, a noisy environment, physical restraint, and the use of sedatives and strong analgesics are some of the contributing factors. Delirium affects both immediate and longerÃ¢â‚¬Âterm health outcomes of critically ill patients as it can increase the length of time a breathing machine is required, time spent in the ICU and in hospital, and the chance of functional weakening and death. The odds of a poor outcome with delirium are increased with frail patients and those of advanced age and already present cognitive difficulties. Frequently, delirious ICU patients are given medicines to help treat symptoms such as agitation. Study characteristics This review is current to 21 March 2019. We found 14 randomized controlled studies that enrolled a total of 1844 adult participants. Six different classes of medicines were tested. These were antipsychotic drugs used as tranquillizers in ten studies; the sedative alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine in three studies; statins that reduce cholesterol in two studies; opioids as part of pain management in one study; serotonin antagonists for nausea and vomiting in one study; and cholinesterase inhibitors, which are medicines for Alzheimer's disease, in one study. Ten studies co pared medicine to placebo Ã¢â‚¬Â an inactive medicine also known as a sugar pill; four studies compared different drugs. Eleven studies with 1153 participants reported on the main outcome of this review Ã¢â‚¬Â duration of delirium. Key findings When drug classes were directly compared with placebo, only the alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine was found to reduce the duration of delirium, and the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine was found to prolong the duration of delirium. Each of these results is based on findings from a single small study. The other drugs when compared to placebo did not change delirium duration. The Review authors used the statistical method of network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis to compare the six different drug classes. Dexmedetomidine was ranked most effective in reducing delirium duration, followed by atypical antipsychotics. However, network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis of delirium duration failed to rule out the possibility of no difference for all six drug classes compared to placebo. Using this method, we did not find that any drug improved the duration of coma, length of stay, longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm cognitive outcomes, or death. The alpha 2 agonist dexmedetomidine shortened time spent on a breathing machine. Adverse events often were not reported in these trials or were rare when reported. An analysis of reported events showed that events were similar to those reported with placebo. We found 10 ongoing studies and six studies awaiting classification that, once published and assessed, may change the conclusions of this review.

J567,2019,Hospital nurseÃ¢â‚¬Âstaffing models and patientÃ¢â‚¬Â and staffÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated outcomes,"- Background Nurses comprise the largest component of the health workforce worldwide and numerous models of workforce allocation and profile have been implemented. These include changes in skill mix, grade mix or qualification mix, staffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âallocation models, staffing levels, nursing shifts, or nursesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ work patterns. This is the first update of our review published in 2011. Objectives The purpose of this review was to explore the effect of hospital nurseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstaffing models on patient and staffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated outcomes in the hospital setting, specifically to identify which staffing model(s) are associated with: 1) better outcomes for patients, 2) better staffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated outcomes, and, 3) the impact of staffing model(s) on cost outcomes. Search methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases and two trials registers were searched on 22 March 2018 together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised trials, nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârandomised trials, controlled beforeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âafter studies and interruptedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtimeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âseries or repeatedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmeasures studies of interventions relating to hospital nurseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstaffing models. Participants were patients and nursing staff working in hospital settings. We included any objective reported measure of patientÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â, staffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated, or economic outcome. The most important outcomes included in this review were: nursingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstaff turnover, patient mortality, patient readmissions, patient attendances at the emergency department (ED), length of stay, patients with pressure ulcers, and costs. Data collection and analysis We worked independently in pairs to extract data from each potentially relevant study and to assess risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included 19 studies, 17 of which were included in the analysis and eight of which we identified for this update. We identified four types of interventions relating to hospital nurseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstaffing models: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â introduction of advanced or specialist nurses to the nursing workforce; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â introduction of nursing assistive personnel to the hospital workforce; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â primary nursing; and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â staffing models. The studies were conducted in the USA, the Netherlands, UK, Australia, and Canada and included patients with cancer, asthma, diabetes and chronic illness, on medical, acute care, intensive care and longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstay psychiatric units. The risk of bias across studies was high, with limitations mainly related to blinding of patients and personnel, allocation concealment, sequence generation, and blinding of outcome assessment. The addition of advanced or specialist nurses to hospital nurse staffing may lead to little or no difference in patient mortality (3 studies, 1358 participants). It is uncertain whether this intervention reduces patient readmissions (7 studies, 2995 participants), patient attendances at the ED (6 studies, 2274 participants), length of stay (3 studies, 907 participants), number of patients with pressure ulcers (1 study, 753 participants), or costs (3 studies, 617 participants), as we assessed the evidence for these outcomes as being of very low certainty. It is uncertain whether adding nursing assistive personnel to the hospital workforce reduces costs (1 study, 6769 participants), as we assessed the evidence for this outcome to be of very low certainty. It is uncertain whether primary nursing (3 studies, > 464 participants) or staffing models (1 study, 647 participants) reduces nursingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstaff turnover, or if primary nursing (2 studies, > 138 participants) reduces costs, as we assessed the evidence for these outcomes to be of very low certainty. Authors' conclusions The findings of this review should be treated with caution due to the limited amount and quality of the published research that was included. We have most confidence in our finding that the introduction of advanced or specialist nurses may lead to little or no difference in one patient outcome (i.e. mortality) with greater uncertainty about other patient outcomes ( .e. readmissions, ED attendance, length of stay and pressure ulcer rates). The evidence is of insufficient certainty to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of other types of interventions, including new nurseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstaffing models and introduction of nursing assistive personnel, on patient, staff and cost outcomes. Although it has been seven years since the original review was published, the certainty of the evidence about hospital nurse staffing still remains very low. Plain language summary What do we know about the impact of hospital nurse staffing on patients, staff and the costs of care? What is the aim of this review? The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if changes made to nurse staffing in hospitals improve outcomes for patients or nurses, or have an impact on the cost of health care. Nurse staffing can refer to the number of nurses per patient, the mix of different types of nurses in a hospital unit, or models used to allocate nurses to patients in a hospital unit. Key messages The research relating to hospital nurse staffing is very limited and the findings should be treated with caution. It is unlikely that adding nurses with advanced nursing skills (Nurse Practitioners (NPs)) or with expertise in a particular area of practice (Clinical Nurse Specialists (CNSs)) to hospital nurse staffing makes any difference to patient death rates. We cannot be sure what other effect it might have on patients, for example, if it reduces the time patients spend in hospital or the costs of patient care. We cannot be sure if changes to the way in which nurses are allocated to patient care reduces the numbers of nurses resigning, or if introducing unqualified nurses to the nursing workforce reduces costs, as the research here is very limited too. What was studied in the review? We found studies that looked at the effects of four main strategies or models of nurse staffing: adding advanced or specialist nurses to the nursing workforce, introducing lessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âqualified nursing personnel to the nursing workforce, changing the way in which nurses are allocated within a hospital unit to provide patient care, and changing the way hospital units schedule nursing shifts. We were most interested in the impact of these interventions on seven main outcomes: nursingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstaff resignations (turnover), patient deaths, patients being readmitted following discharge from the hospital, patients attending the Emergency Department (ED) for care following discharge, the number of days patients stayed in the hospital, the number of patients with pressure sores, and the costs of care. What are the main results of the review? We found 11 studies where advanced or specialist nurses were added to the nursing workforce. None of the studies reported the impact of this intervention on nursingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstaff resignations; three studies found that it may make little or no difference to patient deaths. We cannot be sure whether this intervention has an effect on reducing the number of patients being readmitted following discharge from hospital or attending an ED for care after discharge because the research is very limited. As well, we are uncertain about its effect on reducing the number of days patients stayed in the hospital, the number of patients with pressure sores, or healthcare costs, again because the research is very limited. We found one relevant study that looked at adding nursing assistants to the nursing workforce, which was aimed at reducing costs. We cannot be sure about the effect on costs as the research is very limited. We found five studies of primary nursing (where one nurse is responsible for the total care of a number of patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week) and two studies of nurseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstaffing models. One nurseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstaffing model study tested hospital units scheduling their own nursing shifts (selfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstaffing), and the other study compared different ways to schedule nursing shifts. We cannot be sure about the impact of primary nursing or nurseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstaffing models on nurse resignations or costs because the research is very limited.

J570,2019,Interventions for involving older patients with multiÃ¢â‚¬Âmorbidity in decisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking during primary care consultations,"- Background Older patients with multiple health problems (multiÃ¢â‚¬Âmorbidity) value being involved in decisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking about their health care. However, they are less frequently involved than younger patients. To maximise quality of life, dayÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âday function, and patient safety, older patients require support to identify unmet healthcare needs and to prioritise treatment options. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for older patients with multiÃ¢â‚¬Âmorbidity aiming to involve them in decisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking about their health care during primary care consultations. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; all years to August 2018), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (OvidSP) (1966 to August 2018); Embase (OvidSP) (1988 to August 2018); PsycINFO (OvidSP) (1806 to August 2018); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (Ovid) (1982 to September 2008), then in Ebsco (2009 to August 2018); Centre for Reviews and Dissemination Databases (Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effects (DARE)) (all years to August 2018); the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (all years to August 2018); the Ongoing Reviews Database (all years to August 2018); and Dissertation Abstracts International (1861 to August 2018). Selection criteria We sought randomised controlled trials (RCTs), clusterÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCTs, and quasiÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCTs of interventions to involve patients in decisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking about their health care versus usual care/control/another intervention, for patients aged 65 years and older with multiÃ¢â‚¬Âmorbidity in primary care. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. MetaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis was not possible; therefore we prepared a narrative synthesis. Main results We included three studies involving 1879 participants: two RCTs and one clusterÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCT. Interventions consisted of: Ã‚Â· patient workshop and individual coaching using behaviour change techniques; Ã‚Â· individual patient coaching utilising cognitiveÃ¢â‚¬Âbehavioural therapy and motivational interviewing; and Ã‚Â· holistic patient review, multiÃ¢â‚¬Âdisciplinary practitioner training, and organisational change. No studies reported the primary outcome Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpatient involvement in decisionÃ¢â‚¬ÂmakingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or the primary adverse outcome Ã¢â‚¬Ëœless patient involvement as a result of the interventionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Comparing interventions (patient workshop and individual coaching, holistic patient review plus practitioner training, and organisational change) to usual care: we are uncertain whether interventions had any effect on patient reports of high selfÃ¢â‚¬Ârated health (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 5.49; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) or on patient enablement (mean difference (MD) 0.60, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â9.23 to 10.43; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) compared with usual care. Interventions probably had no effect on healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life (adjusted difference in means 0.00, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.02 to 0.02; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) or on medication adherence (MD 0.06, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.05 to 0.17; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) but probably improved the number of patients discussing their priorities (adjusted odds ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.38; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and probably increased the number of nurse consultations (incident rate ratio from adjusted multiÃ¢â‚¬Âlevel Poisson model 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.61; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) compared with usual care. Practitioner outcomes were not measured. Interventions were not reported to adversely affect rates of participant death or anxiety, emergency department attendance, or hospital admission compared with usual care. Comparing interventions (patient workshop and coaching, individual patient coaching) to attentionÃ¢â‚¬Âcontrol conditions: we are uncertain whether interventions affect patientÃ¢â‚¬Âreported high selfÃ¢â‚¬Ârated health (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.00, favouring attention control, with very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence; RR 2.17, 95% CI 0.85 to 5.52, favouring the intervention, with very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertain y evidence). We are uncertain whether interventions affect patient enablement and engagement by increasing either patient activation (MD 1.20, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â8.21 to 10.61; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) or selfÃ¢â‚¬Âefficacy (MD 0.29, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.21 to 0.79; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); or whether interventions affect the number of general practice visits (MD 0.51, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.34 to 1.36; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), compared to attentionÃ¢â‚¬Âcontrol conditions. The intervention may however lead to more patientÃ¢â‚¬Âreported changes in management of their health conditions (RR 1.82, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.44; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Practitioner outcomes were not measured. Interventions were not reported to adversely affect emergency department attendance nor hospital admission when compared with attention control. Comparing one form of intervention with another: not measured. There was 'unclear' risk across studies for performance bias, detection bias, and reporting bias; however, no aspects were 'high' risk. Evidence was downgraded via GRADE, most often because of 'small sample size' and 'evidence from a single study'. Authors' conclusions Limited available evidence does not allow a robust conclusion regarding the objectives of this review. Whilst patient involvement in decisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking is seen as a key mechanism for improving care, it is rarely examined as an intervention and was not measured by included studies. Consistency in design, analysis, and evaluation of interventions would enable a greater likelihood of robust conclusions in future reviews. Plain language summary Interventions for involving older patients with more than one longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm health problem in decisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking during primary care consultations Background The number of older people with more than one longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm health problem is steadily increasing worldwide. Such individuals can have complicated healthcare needs. Although they frequently want to be involved in making decisions about their health care, they are less often involved than younger, healthier people. As a result, they may not be offered the same treatment options. Review question We reviewed available evidence about the effects of interventions intended to involve older people with more than one longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm health problem in decisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking about their health care during primary care consultations. Study characteristics We included research published up until August 2018. We found three relevant studies involving 1879 participants. These studies were reported from three countries. Participants were over 65 years of age with three or more longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm health problems on average. Interventions investigated included: Ã‚Â· patient workshops and individual patient coaching; Ã‚Â· patient coaching including cognitiveÃ¢â‚¬Âbehavioural therapy; and Ã‚Â· wholeÃ¢â‚¬Âperson patient review, practitioner training, and organisational changes. All studies were funded by national research bodies. Key results None of the studies reported the main outcome Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpatient involvement in decisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking about their health careÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ nor whether there was less patient involvement as a result of the intervention. Interventions were not found to increase adverse outcomes such as death, anxiety, emergency department attendance, or hospital admissions.. We are uncertain whether interventions for involving older people with more than one longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm health problem in decisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking about their health care can improve their selfÃ¢â‚¬Ârated health or healthcare engagement, or make any difference in selfÃ¢â‚¬Âefficacy (one's belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations) or in the overall number of general practice visits. We can report that these interventions probably make little or no difference in patients' quality of life but probably increase the number of patients discussing their priorities, and are associated with more patient consultations with nurses, when compared to usual care. Interventions may be associated with more changes in the management of health conditions when considered from the patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective whe compared with a control group. The quality of the evidence was limited by small studies, and by studies choosing to measure different outcomes, resulting in lack of data that could be combined in analyses.

J571,2019,Alternative community-based models of care for young people with anorexia nervosa: the CostED national surveillance study,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: Evidence suggests that investing in specialist eating disorders services for young people with anorexia nervosa could have important implications for the NHS, with the potential to improve health outcomes and reduce costs through reductions in the number and length of hospital admissions.
<b>OBJECTIVES</b>: The primary objectives were to evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of alternative community-based models of service provision for young people with anorexia nervosa and to model the impact of potential changes to the provision of specialist services.
<b>DESIGN</b>: Observational surveillance study using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Surveillance System.
<b>SETTING</b>: Community-based secondary or tertiary child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
<b>PARTICIPANTS</b>: A total of 298 young people aged 8-17 years in contact with CAMHS for a first episode of anorexia nervosa in accordance with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnostic criteria.
<b>INTERVENTIONS</b>: Community-based specialist eating disorders services and generic CAMHS.
<b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</b>: Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) score (primary outcome) and percentage of median expected body mass index (BMI) for age and sex (%mBMI) (secondary outcome) were assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.
<b>DATA SOURCES</b>: Data were collected by clinicians from clinical records.
<b>RESULTS</b>: Total costs incurred by young people initially assessed in specialist eating disorders services were not significantly different from those incurred by young people initially assessed in generic CAMHS. However, adjustment for baseline covariates resulted in observed differences favouring specialist services (costs were lower, on average) because of the significantly poorer clinical status of the specialist group at baseline. At the 6-month follow-up, mean %mBMI was significantly higher in the specialist group, but no other significant differences in outcomes were evident. Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that initial assessment in a specialist service has a higher probability of being cost-effective than initial assessment in generic CAMHS, as determined by CGAS score and %mBMI. However, no firm conclusion can be drawn without knowledge of society's willingness to pay for improvements in these outcomes. Decision modelling did not support the hypothesis that changes to the provision of specialist services would generate savings for the NHS, with results suggesting that cost per 10-point improvement in CGAS score (improvement from one CGAS category to the next) varies little as the percentage of participants taking the specialist or generic pathway is varied.
<b>LIMITATIONS</b>: Follow-up rates were lower than expected, but the sample was still larger than has been achieved to date in RCTs carried out in this population in the UK, and an exploration of the impact of missing cost and outcome data produced very similar results to those of the main analyses.
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: The results of this study suggest that initial assessment in a specialist eating disorders service for young people with anorexia nervosa may have a higher probability of being cost-effective than initial assessment in generic CAMHS, although the associated uncertainty makes it hard to draw firm conclusions. Although costs and outcomes were similar, young people in specialist services were more severely ill at baseline, suggesting that specialist services were achieving larger clinical effectiveness gains without the need for additional expenditure. The results did not suggest that providing more specialist services would save money for the NHS, given similar costs and outcomes, so decisions about which service type to fund could be made with reference to other factors, such as the preferences of patients and carers.
<b>FUTURE WORK</b>: Data on measures of quality of life capable of generating quality-adjusted life-years are needed to confirm the cost-effectiveness of specialist services.

J574,2019,Abstract 2415: Polygenic risk-tailored screening for prostate cancer: A costeffectiveness Analysis,"Background Screening for prostate cancer with prostate specific antigen (PSA) remains controversial. Risk-tailoring based on age and polygenic profile might conserve the benefits of PSA screening whilst reducing overdiagnosis. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness and benefit-to-harm balance of polygenic risk-tailored screening for prostate cancer. Methods A life-table approach was used. A hypothetical cohort of 4.48 million men in England between the ages of 55 and 70 was followed to the age of 90. Three scenarios were compared: No screening, age-based screening (PSA testing every four years from 55 to 70), and risk-tailored screening based on age and polygenic risk profile (men above the risk threshold receive PSA testing four-yearly from the age they reach the risk threshold to 70). The number of prostate cancer cases, deaths from prostate cancer, overdiagnosed cases, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost per QALY, and net monetary benefit were calculated. Sensitivity analyses investigated the impact of parameter uncertainty, and the impact of varying the risk threshold, on outcomes. Costs were estimated from the perspective of the UK National Health Service; both costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. Results The incremental cost per additional QALY for age-based screening compared to no screening was 58,254 ($75,899), with 27% simulations having an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than 20,000 ($26,058), the threshold set by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for an intervention to be considered costeffective. In risk-tailored screening, as the 10-year absolute risk-threshold was progressively increased from 2.6%, equivalent to the 10-year absolute risk of a 55-year old man, to 7.1%, the corresponding risk of a 69-year old man, the cost per additional QALY gained reduced from 36,065 ($46,989) to 26,210 ($34,149), when compared to no screening. By comparison with age-based screening, risk-tailored screening with a threshold between 2.6% and 7.1% led to 8 (2.5%) and 45 (13%) fewer deaths prevented from prostate cancer per 10,000 men, with a 0.1% rise and 10% reduction in costs, respectively. Raising the risk threshold from 2.6% to 7.1% led to fewer men being screened (cumulative total of 35% of men screened by comparison with 83%), 53% fewer overdiagnosed cases, 22% fewer biopsies and 10% lower costs, at the expense of 10% fewer prostate cancer deaths averted. Conclusion Risk-tailored screening reduces the harms of screening for prostate cancer whilst preserving much of the mortality benefit. This study raises the prospect of risktailored population-based screening for prostate cancer; the precise risk-thresholds selected will depend on societal judgements regarding the appropriate trade-offs between harms and benefits.",TRUE,Study conducted in England and uses NHS data.,TRUE,Study evaluates screening in NHS context.,TRUE,"Appears to be a conference abstract, a form of grey literature.",Grey literature,0.9,TRUE,Comparative cost-effectiveness analysis with primary outcomes on cost and impact.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['cost', 'qaly', 'clinical', 'safety']",0.95
J575,2019,Polygenic risk-tailored screening for prostate cancer: A benefit-harm and cost-effectiveness modelling study,"Background The United States Preventive Services Task Force supports individualised decision-making for prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening in men aged 55-69. Knowing how the potential benefits and harms of screening vary by an individual's risk of developing prostate cancer could inform decision-making about screening at both an individual and population level. This modelling study examined the benefit-harm tradeoffs and the cost-effectiveness of a risk-tailored screening programme compared to age-based and no screening. Methods and findings A life-table model, projecting age-specific prostate cancer incidence and mortality, was developed of a hypothetical cohort of 4.48 million men in England aged 55 to 69 years with follow-up to age 90. Risk thresholds were based on age and polygenic profile. We compared no screening, age-based screening (quadrennial PSA testing from 55 to 69), and risk-tailored screening (men aged 55 to 69 years with a 10-year absolute risk greater than a threshold receive quadrennial PSA testing from the age they reach the risk threshold). The analysis was undertaken from the health service perspective, including direct costs borne by the health system for risk assessment, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. We used probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account for parameter uncertainty and discounted future costs and benefits at 3.5% per year. Our analysis should be considered cautiously in light of limitations related to our model's cohort-based structure and the uncertainty of input parameters in mathematical models. Compared to no screening over 35 years follow-up, age-based screening prevented the most deaths from prostate cancer (39,272, 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 16,792-59,685) at the expense of 94,831 (95% UI: 84,827-105,630) overdiagnosed cancers. Age-based screening was the least cost-effective strategy studied. The greatest number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was generated by risk-based screening at a 10-year absolute risk threshold of 4%. At this threshold, risk-based screening led to one-third fewer overdiagnosed cancers (64,384, 95% UI: 57,382-72,050) but averted 6.3% fewer (9,695, 95% UI: 2,853-15,851) deaths from prostate cancer by comparison with age-based screening. Relative to no screening, risk-based screening at a 4% 10-year absolute risk threshold was cost-effective in 48.4% and 57.4% of the simulations at willingness-to-pay thresholds of GBP20,000 (US$26,000) and 30,000 ($39,386) per QALY, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of risk-tailored screening improved as the threshold rose. Conclusions Based on the results of this modelling study, offering screening to men at higher risk could potentially reduce overdiagnosis and improve the benefit-harm tradeoff and the cost-effectiveness of a prostate cancer screening program. The optimal threshold will depend on societal judgements of the appropriate balance of benefits-harms and cost-effectiveness. Copyright: Ã‚Â© 2019 Callender et al.

J583,2019,Community pharmacy personnel interventions for smoking cessation,"- Background Community pharmacists could provide effective smoking cessation treatment because they offer easy access to members of the community. They are well placed to provide both advice on the correct use of smoking cessation products and behavioural support to aid smoking cessation. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions delivered by community pharmacy personnel to assist people to stop smoking, with or without concurrent use of pharmacotherapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, along with clinicaltrials.gov and the ICTRP, for smoking cessation studies conducted in a community pharmacy setting, using the search terms pharmacist* or pharmacy or pharmacies. Date of the most recent search: January 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of interventions delivered by community pharmacy personnel to promote smoking cessation amongst their clients who were smokers, compared with usual pharmacy support or any less intensive programme. The main outcome measure was smoking cessation rates at six months or more after the start of the intervention. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane for study screening, data extraction and management. We conducted a metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis using a MantelÃ¢â‚¬ÂHaenszel randomÃ¢â‚¬Âeffects model to generate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results We identified seven studies including 1774 participants. We judged three studies to be at high risk of bias and four to be at unclear risk. Each study provided faceÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âface behavioural support delivered by pharmacy staff, and required pharmacy personnel training. Typically such programmes comprised support starting before quit day and continuing with weekly appointments for several weeks afterwards. Comparators were either minimal or less intensive behavioural support for smoking cessation, typically comprising a few minutes of oneÃ¢â‚¬Âoff advice on how to quit. Participants in both intervention and control arms received equivalent smoking cessation pharmacotherapy in all but one study. All studies took place in highÃ¢â‚¬Âincome countries, and recruited participants visiting pharmacies. We pooled six studies of 1614 participants and detected a benefit of more intensive behavioural smoking cessation interventions delivered by community pharmacy personnel compared with less intensive cessation interventions at longest followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.97; I 2 = 54%; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Community pharmacists can provide effective behavioural support to people trying to stop smoking. However, this conclusion is based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, limited by risk of bias and imprecision. Further research could change this conclusion. Plain language summary Does quitÃ¢â‚¬Âsmoking support delivered by community pharmacy staff help people to stop smoking? Background Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disease worldwide. Community pharmacists are respected healthcare professionals who provide easily accessible and convenient healthcare services to their communities, and they are well placed to provide their clients with help to quit smoking. Indeed, many governments recognise community pharmacies as a useful way of delivering many healthcare services. However, we need evidence that these services are effective before we develop them more widely. Study characteristics We searched for relevant studies in January 2019, and found seven studies including 1774 people. Three studies took place in the UK, and one each in Australia, United States, Qatar, and Italy. Each study provided faceÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âface behavioural support delivered by pharmacy staff, who received specific training. Studies compared the structured programme to less intensive support to stop smoking. Key results We found evidence that more intensive structured care given by community pharmacy staff probably helps more people to quit smoking than less intensive support to quit. Qualit of the evidence We found lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence that community pharmacy support helps people to quit smoking. Limitations of the evidence came from potential problems with the ways some of the studies were carried out and the low numbers of people who quit smoking across the included studies, which means we are not sure how effective these programmes really are.",TRUE,Three studies conducted in the UK.,TRUE,Study occurs in community pharmacy settings.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article assessing smoking cessation interventions.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Randomised controlled trials with clinical outcomes.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,['clinical'],0.95
J586,2019,Medical treatment for botulism,"- Background Botulism is an acute paralytic illness caused by a neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum . Supportive care, including intensive care, is key, but the role of other medical treatments is unclear. This is an update of a review first published in 2011. Objectives To assess the effects of medical treatments on mortality, duration of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, tube or parenteral feeding, and risk of adverse events in botulism. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase on 23 January 2018. We reviewed bibliographies and contacted authors and experts. We searched two clinical trials registers, WHO ICTRP and clinicaltrials.gov, on 21 February 2019. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasiÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCTs examining the medical treatment of any of the four major types of botulism (infant intestinal botulism, foodÃ¢â‚¬Âborne botulism, wound botulism, and adult intestinal toxemia). Potential medical treatments included equine serum trivalent botulism antitoxin, humanÃ¢â‚¬Âderived botulinum immune globulin intravenous (BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV), plasma exchange, 3,4Ã¢â‚¬Âdiaminopyridine, and guanidine. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcome was inÃ¢â‚¬Âhospital death from any cause occurring within four weeks from randomization or the beginning of treatment. Secondary outcomes were death from any cause occurring within 12 weeks, duration of hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of tube or parenteral feeding, and proportion of participants with adverse events or complications of treatment. Main results A single RCT met the inclusion criteria. Our 2018 search update identified no additional trials. The included trial evaluated BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV for the treatment of infant botulism and included 59 treatment participants and 63 control participants. The control group received a control immune globulin that did not have an effect on botulinum toxin. Participants were followed during the length of their hospitalization to measure the outcomes of interest. There was some violation of intentionÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âtreat principles, and possibly some betweenÃ¢â‚¬Âtreatment group imbalances among participants admitted to the intensive care unit and mechanically ventilated, but otherwise the risk of bias was low. There were no deaths in either group, making any treatment effect on mortality inestimable. There was a benefit in the treatment group on mean duration of hospitalization (BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV: 2.60 weeks, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.95 to 3.25; control: 5.70 weeks, 95% CI 4.40 to 7.00; mean difference (MD) Ã¢â‚¬Â3.10 weeks, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â4.52 to Ã¢â‚¬Â1.68; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); mechanical ventilation (BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV: 1.80 weeks, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.40; control: 4.40 weeks, 95% CI 3.00 to 5.80; MD Ã¢â‚¬Â2.60 weeks, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â4.06 to Ã¢â‚¬Â1.14; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); and tube or parenteral feeding (BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV: 3.60 weeks, 95% CI 1.70 to 5.50; control: 10.00 weeks, 95% CI 6.85 to 13.15; MD Ã¢â‚¬Â6.40 weeks, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â10.00 to Ã¢â‚¬Â2.80; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), but not on proportion of participants with adverse events or complications (BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV: 63.08%; control: 68.75%; risk ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.18; absolute risk reduction 0.06, 95% CI 0.22 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.11; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions We found lowÃ¢â‚¬Â and moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence supporting the use of BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV in infant intestinal botulism. A single RCT demonstrated that BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV probably decreases the duration of hospitalization; may decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation; and probably decreases the duration of tube or parenteral feeding. Adverse events were probably no more frequent with immune globulin than with placebo. Our search did not reveal any evidence examining the use of other medical treatments including serum trivalent botulism antitoxin. Plain language summary Medical treatment for botulism Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effect of medical treatment on human botulism. Background Botuli m is a serious illness that starts suddenly and causes paralysis (an inability to use muscles). The cause of botulism is a germ called Clostridium botulinum . If the illness is left untreated, many people with botulism will die. There are four main types of botulism: adult and infant types where the intestine (gut) is infected; botulism from contaminated food; and wound botulism. We searched for clinical trials of medical treatments for any of the four major types of botulism. We assessed the effects of treatment on the rate of deaths in hospital from any cause within four weeks of infection. We were also interested in deaths within 12 weeks, length of hospital stay, the need for a ventilator to help with breathing (mechanical ventilation), feeding by tube, and harmful events of treatment. Study characteristics Our searches of the medical literature revealed one relevant study, which was in infant botulism. The treatment was a single dose of a medicine made from human immune proteins (humanÃ¢â‚¬Âderived botulinum immune globulin intravenous, or BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV). FiftyÃ¢â‚¬Ânine infants received BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV, and 63 infants received a placebo (inactive treatment). Each study participant was followed up for the duration of their hospitalization. This study was sponsored by the California Department of Health Services. Key results and certainty of the evidence There were no deaths in either group in the trial. Infants treated with BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV spent, on average, about three weeks less time in hospital (i.e. 3.1 weeks versus 5.7 weeks) than infants who received the inactive treatment, and spent about three weeks less on a ventilator (1.8 weeks versus 4.4 weeks). The average duration of tube feeding in the BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV group was more than six weeks less than in the placebo group (i.e. 3.6 versus 10 weeks). The risk of harmful effects of the treatment was probably no greater with BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV than with the inactive treatment. The evidence was mostly of moderate certainty (low certainty for time spent on a ventilator). The review shows that BIGÃ¢â‚¬ÂIV probably shortens hospitalization; may shorten time spent on a ventilator; and probably reduces the duration of tube feeding compared to placebo. On the other hand, we found no evidence for or against botulism antitoxin or other treatments for botulism.

J590,2019,Lost cost savings to the NHS in England due to the delayed entry of multiple generic low-dose transdermal buprenorphine: A case scenario analysis,"Objective: Originator pharmaceutical companies prolonging the patent of a medicine prevents rivals' entry to the market and competition. As the entry of generic alternatives usually results in price reduction, any delay in their entry potentially deprives the National Health Service (NHS) of much-needed savings. This study estimates the potential cost savings lost to the NHS as a result of delayed entry of generic low-dose buprenorphine (LDTB) patches in England. Design(s): Two case scenarios were modelled to determine the savings from the entry of generic LDTB Butec only between February and August 2016 and the potential savings which could have been achieved if all generic LDTB patches had entered the market at the same time. Setting(s): The volume of utilisation of branded and generic LDTB in UK primary care was derived from the NHS business services authority website for prescriptions dispensed between February 2015 and January 2018. Main Outcome Measure(s): Cost savings associated with the entry of generic LDTB. Result(s): The cumulative cost savings from the introduction of Butec alone was 0.7 ($0.92) million. The model predicted that if all generic buprenorphine entered the market at the same time with Butec, they could have been achieved a 1.2 ($1.57) million saving. This means that approximately 0.5 ($0.65) million savings was lost to the NHS over the 6-month time period. Conclusion(s): The entry of Butec was associated with cost savings. We estimated that more cost savings could have been achieved if other generic LDTB patches had entered the market at the same time to drive competition between rivals. Patent protection strategies which delayed the entry of multiple generics were responsible for the reduced cost savings to the NHS in England.

J594,2019,Cost-effectiveness of ventricular tachycardia catheter ablation: Limitations in the current trial evidence base,"Introduction Comparative effectiveness research has emerged as a main area of focus in order to highlight and develop more cost-effective evidence based treatments. Within cardiovascular medicine, randomised clinical trials (RCTs) have suffered from criticisms including a lack of generalisability as well as a lack of analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the different interventions being studied. Such analyses are used by organisations including the National institute for Health and Care excellence (NICE) to inform system-level decisions regarding which treatments the NHS should fund. In cardiology, treatments often involve expensive technologies, with the potential for a growing chasm to exist between what is the latest and greatest innovation and what can be afforded on the frontline. Aim To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ventricular tachycardia (VT) catheter ablation versus anti-arrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy in ischemic heart disease. Methods A decision-analytic Markov model was used to calculate the costs and health outcomes of catheter ablation or AAD treatment of VT for a hypothetical cohort of patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Model inputs where informed using RCT-level evidence [table 1] wherever possible and health states were selected according to evidence of pragmatically measurable differences between each state [figure 1]. Health states that did not have any patientreported HRQL data supporting the calculation of a QALY value were excluded. Costs were calculated from a UK perspective. Results Catheter ablation versus AAD therapy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 144,150 (161,448) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, over a five-year time horizon [table 2]. The ICER for a tenyear time horizon was 75,074 (84,083) and 69,986 (e78,384) over the cohort's lifetime. Using probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account for model parameter uncertainty, the likelihood of catheter ablation being cost-effective was only 11%, assuming a willingness to pay threshold of 30,000 used by the NICE [figure 2]. One-way sensitivity analyses suggested that cost-effectiveness inferences were robust to a wide range of departures from base-case assumptions, including changes in baseline mortality, procedural mortality and readmission rate. Conclusion Catheter ablation of VT is unlikely to be costeffective compared with AAD therapy alone in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy implanted with an ICD based on pooled trial evidence. However, better designed studies incorporating detailed and more frequent quality of life assessment are needed to advise health policy in this field and to provide more informed cost-effectiveness analyses.

J595,2019,Peer support for people with schizophrenia or other serious mental illness,"- Background Peer support provides the opportunity for peers with experiential knowledge of a mental illness to give emotional, appraisal and informational assistance to current service users, and is becoming an important recoveryÃ¢â‚¬Âoriented approach in healthcare for people with mental illness. Objectives To assess the effects of peerÃ¢â‚¬Âsupport interventions for people with schizophrenia or other serious mental disorders, compared to standard care or other supportive or psychosocial interventions not from peers. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's StudyÃ¢â‚¬ÂBased Register of Trials on 27 July 2016 and 4 July 2017. There were no limitations regarding language, date, document type or publication status. Selection criteria We selected all randomised controlled clinical studies involving people diagnosed with schizophrenia or other related serious mental illness that compared peer support to standard care or other psychosocial interventions and that did not involve 'peer' individual/group(s). We included studies that met our inclusion criteria and reported useable data. Our primary outcomes were service use and global state (relapse). Data collection and analysis The authors of this review complied with the Cochrane recommended standard of conduct for data screening and collection. Two review authors independently screened the studies, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion until the authors reached a consensus. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary data, and the mean difference and its 95% CI for continuous data. We used a randomÃ¢â‚¬Âeffects model for analyses. We assessed the quality of evidence and created a 'Summary of findings' table using the GRADE approach. Main results This review included 13 studies with 2479 participants. All included studies compared peer support in addition to standard care with standard care alone. We had significant concern regarding risk of bias of included studies as over half had an unclear risk of bias for the majority of the risk domains (i.e. random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, attrition and selective reporting). Additional concerns regarding blinding of participants and outcome assessment, attrition and selective reporting were especially serious, as about a quarter of the included studies were at high risk of bias for these domains. All included studies provided useable data for analyses but only two trials provided useable data for two of our main outcomes of interest, and there were no data for one of our primary outcomes, relapse. Peer support appeared to have little or no effect on hospital admission at medium term (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.75; participants = 19; studies = 1, very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) or allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause death in the long term (RR 1.52, 95% CI 0.43 to 5.31; participants = 555; studies = 1, very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). There were no useable data for our other prespecified important outcomes: days in hospital, clinically important change in global state (improvement), clinically important change in quality of life for peer supporter and service user, or increased cost to society. One trial compared peer support with clinicianÃ¢â‚¬Âled support but did not report any useable data for the above main outcomes. Authors' conclusions Currently, very limited data are available for the effects of peer support for people with schizophrenia. The risk of bias within trials is of concern and we were unable to use the majority of data reported in the included trials. In addition, the few that were available, were of very low quality. The current body of evidence is insufficient to either refute or support the use of peerÃ¢â‚¬Âsupport interventions for people with schizophrenia and other mental illness. Plain language summary Peer support for schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses Background Schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses are chronic disruptive mental disorders with disturbing psychot c, affective and cognitive symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, depression, anxiety, insomnia, difficulty in concentration, suspiciousness and social withdrawal. The primary treatment is antipsychotic medicine, but these are not always fully effective. Peer support provides the opportunity for both a service user and a provider of care to share knowledge, direct experience of their illness and to help each other along the path to recovery. The support is given alongside antipsychotic treatment. Through interpersonal sharing, modelling and assistance within or outside of group sessions, it is believed that these supportive strategies can help combat feelings of hopelessness and behavioural problems that may result from having an illness and empower people to continue their treatment and help them to resume key roles in real life. However, findings from research have been inconsistent regarding the effectiveness of peer support for people with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses. Review aims This review aimed to find highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence from relevant randomised clinical trials (studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) so we could assess the effects of peerÃ¢â‚¬Âsupport interventions for people with serious mental illness in comparison to standard care or other supportive or psychosocial interventions not from peers. We were interested in finding clinically meaningful data that could provide information regarding the effect peer support has on hospital admission, relapse, global state, quality of life, death and cost to society for people with schizophrenia. Searches We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's specialised register of trials (up to 2017) and found 13 trials that randomised 2479 people with schizophrenia or other similar serious mental illnesses to receive either peer support plus their standard care, clinicianÃ¢â‚¬Âled support plus their standard care or standard care alone. Key results Thirteen trials were available but the evidence was very low quality. Useable data were reported for only two of our prespecified outcomes of importance and showed adding peer support to standard care appeared to have little or no clear impact on hospital admission or death for people with schizophrenia and other serious mental illnesses. One of these trials (participants = 156) also compared peer support with clinicianÃ¢â‚¬Âled support (where a health professional provided support). However, there were no useable data for this comparison reported for the main outcomes. Conclusions We have little confidence in the above findings.

J598,2019,A modelling study of the budget impact of improved glycaemic control in adults with Type 1 diabetes in the UK,"Aims: To develop a novel interactive budget impact model that assesses affordability of diabetes treatments in specific populations, and to test the model in a hypothetical scenario by estimating cost savings resulting from reduction in HbA<inf>1c</inf> from >=69 mmol/mol (8.5%) to a target of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) in adults with Type 1 diabetes in the UK. Method(s): A dynamic, interactive model was created using the projected incidence and progression over a 5-year horizon of diabetes-related complications (micro- and macrovascular disease, severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis) for different HbA<inf>1c</inf> levels, with flexible input of population size, complications and therapy costs, HbA<inf>1c</inf> distribution and other variables. The model took a National Health Service and societal perspective. Result(s): The model was developed, and in the proposed hypothetical situation, reductions in complications and expected costs evaluated. Achievement of target HbA<inf>1c</inf> in individuals with HbA<inf>1c</inf> >=69 mmol/mol (8.5%) would reduce expected chronic complications from 6.8 to 1.2 events per 100 person-years, and diabetic ketoacidosis from 14.5 to 1.0 events per 100 person-years. Potential cumulative direct cost savings achievable in the modelled population were estimated at 687 m over 5 years (5,585/person), with total (direct and indirect) savings of 1,034 m (8,400/person). Conclusion(s): Implementation of strategies aimed at achieving target glucose levels in people with Type 1 diabetes in the UK has the potential to drive a significant reduction in complication costs. This estimate may provide insights into the potential for investment in achieving savings through improved diabetes care in the UK.

J599,2019,Interventions for hand eczema,"- Background Hand eczema is an inflammation of the skin of the hands that tends to run a chronic, relapsing course. This common condition is often associated with itch, social stigma, and impairment in employment. Many different interventions of unknown effectiveness are used to treat hand eczema. Objectives To assess the effects of topical and systemic interventions for hand eczema in adults and children. Search methods We searched the following up to April 2018: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, LILACS, GREAT, and four trials registries. We checked the reference lists of included studies for further references to relevant trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared interventions for hand eczema, regardless of hand eczema type and other affected sites, versus no treatment, placebo, vehicle, or active treatments. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were participantÃ¢â‚¬Â and investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated good/excellent control of symptoms, and adverse events. Main results We included 60 RCTs, conducted in secondary care (5469 participants with mild to severe chronic hand eczema). Most participants were over 18 years old. The duration of treatment was short, generally up to four months. Only 24 studies included a followÃ¢â‚¬Âup period. Clinical heterogeneity in treatments and outcome measures was evident. Few studies performed headÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âhead comparisons of different interventions. Risk of bias varied considerably, with only five studies at low risk in all domains. TwentyÃ¢â‚¬Âtwo studies were industryÃ¢â‚¬Âfunded. Eighteen trials studied topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors; 10 studies, phototherapy; three studies, systemic immunosuppressives; and five studies, oral retinoids. Most studies compared an active intervention against no treatment, variants of the same medication, or placebo (or vehicle). Below, we present results from the main comparisons. Corticosteroid creams/ointments: when assessed 15 days after the start of treatment, clobetasol propionate 0.05% foam probably improves participantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated control of symptoms compared to vehicle (risk ratio (RR) 2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38 to 3.91; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 3, 95% CI 2 to 8; 1 study, 125 participants); the effect of clobetasol compared to vehicle for investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated improvement is less clear (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.40). More participants had at least one adverse event with clobetasol (11/62 versus 5/63; RR 2.24, 95% CI 0.82 to 6.06), including application site burning/pruritus. This evidence was rated as moderate certainty. When assessed 36 weeks after the start of treatment, mometasone furoate cream used thrice weekly may slightly improve investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated symptom control compared to twice weekly (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.61; 1 study, 72 participants) after remission is reached. ParticipantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated symptoms were not measured. Some mild atrophy was reported in both groups (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.45 to 6.83; 5/35 versus 3/37). This evidence was rated as low certainty. Irradiation with ultraviolet (UV) light: local combination ultraviolet light therapy (PUVA) may lead to improvement in investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated symptom control when compared to local narrowÃ¢â‚¬Âband UVB after 12 weeks of treatment (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.16; 1 study, 60 participants). However, the 95% CI indicates that PUVA might make little or no difference. ParticipantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated symptoms were not measured. Adverse events (mainly erythema) were reported by 9/30 participants in the narrowÃ¢â‚¬Âband UVB group versus none in the PUVA group. This evidence was rated as moderate certainty. Topical calcineurin inhibitors: tacrolimus 0.1% over two weeks probably improves investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated symptom control measured after three weeks compared to vehicle (14/14 tacrolimus versus 0/14 vehicle; 1 study). ParticipantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated symptoms were not measured. Four of 14 people in the tacroli us group versus zero in the vehicle group had wellÃ¢â‚¬Âtolerated application site burning/itching. A withinÃ¢â‚¬Âparticipant study in 16 participants compared 0.1% tacrolimus to 0.1% mometasone furoate but did not measure investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Â or participantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated symptoms. Both treatments were well tolerated when assessed at two weeks during four weeks of treatment. Evidence from these studies was rated as moderate certainty. Oral interventions: oral cyclosporin 3 mg/kg/d probably slightly improves investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated (RR 1.88, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.99; 1 study, 34 participants) or participantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.27) control of symptoms compared to topical betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% after six weeks of treatment. The risk of adverse events such as dizziness was similar between groups (up to 36 weeks; RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.86, n = 55; 15/27 betamethasone versus 19/28 cyclosporin). The evidence was rated as moderate certainty. Alitretinoin 10 mg improves investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated symptom control compared with placebo (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.07; NNTB 11, 95% CI 6.3 to 26.5; 2 studies, n = 781) and alitretinoin 30 mg also improves this outcome compared with placebo (RR 2.75, 95% CI 2.20 to 3.43; NNTB 4, 95% CI 3 to 5; 2 studies, n = 1210). Similar results were found for participantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated symptom control: alitretinoin 10 mg RR 1.73 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.40) and 30 mg RR 2.75 (95% CI 2.18 to 3.48). Evidence was rated as high certainty. The number of adverse events (including headache) probably did not differ between alitretinoin 10 mg and placebo (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.55; 1 study, n = 158; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), but the risk of headache increased with alitretinoin 30 mg (RR 3.43, 95% CI 2.45 to 4.81; 2 studies, n = 1210; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Outcomes were assessed between 48 and 72 weeks. Authors' conclusions Most findings were from single studies with low precision, so they should be interpreted with caution. Topical corticosteroids and UV phototherapy were two of the major standard treatments, but evidence is insufficient to support one specific treatment over another. The effect of topical calcineurin inhibitors is not certain. Alitretinoin is more effective than placebo in controlling symptoms, but advantages over other treatments need evaluating. WellÃ¢â‚¬Âdesigned and wellÃ¢â‚¬Âreported, longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (more than three months), headÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âhead studies comparing different treatments are needed. Consensus is required regarding the definition of hand eczema and its subtypes, and a standard severity scale should be established. The main limitation was heterogeneity between studies. Small sample size impacted our ability to detect differences between treatments. Plain language summary Treatments for hand eczema Review question We reviewed evidence on the effects of topical and systemic (oral or injected medicines that work throughout the entire body) treatments for hand eczema when compared against placebo (an identical but inactive treatment), no treatment, vehicle (inactive ingredients that help deliver an active treatment), or another treatment. We included 60 randomised trials (5469 participants) published up to April 2018. Background Hand eczema is an inflammation of the skin of the hands that can be caused by contact allergens (i.e. substances that cause an allergic reaction) such as rubber chemicals, but other external factors (e.g. irritants such as water or detergents) and atopic predisposition are often important triggers. Hand eczema can cause a reduction in quality of life leading to many workÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated problems. Various types of hand eczema exist, and different topical (creams, ointments, or lotions) and systemic treatments with unknown effectiveness can be used. Study characteristics Most participants were hospital outpatients over 18 years of age with mild to severe chronic hand eczema. Treatment was usually given for up to four months, and outcomes were mainly assessed after treatment. A large variety of treatments were studied and compared to no treatment, variants of the same medication placebo, or vehicle. TwentyÃ¢â‚¬Âtwo studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Key results Limited data are available to support the best way of managing hand eczema due to varying study quality and inability to pool data from studies with similar interventions. Corticosteroid creams/ointments and phototherapy (irradiation with UV light) are the major treatment options, although comparisons between these options are lacking. Below, we present results for the main comparisons of interest. Corticosteroid creams/ointments: clobetasol propionate foam probably increases participantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated good/excellent control of hand eczema when compared to vehicle (516 versus 222 per 1000), but the difference between groups was less clear for investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated control, and more adverse events were reported with clobetasol propionate (178 versus 79 per 1000) (all based on moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Mometasone furoate cream used thrice weekly may slightly improve investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated good/excellent control compared to twice weekly treatment, and participantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated control was not measured. Mild skin thinning occurred in both groups, but cases were few (all based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Irradiation with UV light: various types of irradiation (i.e. exposure to radiation) were compared. Local PUVA may improve investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated good/excellent control compared to narrowÃ¢â‚¬Âband UVB (400 versus 200 per 1000); however, we are uncertain of this finding because results also show that local PUVA may make little or no difference. ParticipantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated symptoms were not measured. Nine out of 30 participants in the narrowÃ¢â‚¬Âband UVB group reported adverse events (mainly redness) compared to none in the PUVA group (all based on moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Topical calcineurin inhibitors: people receiving tacrolimus are probably more likely to achieve improved investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated good/excellent symptom control compared to those given vehicle (14/14 participants with tacrolimus compared to none with vehicle), but participantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated control of symptoms was not measured. Four of 14 people in the tacrolimus group versus zero in the vehicle group had wellÃ¢â‚¬Âtolerated application site burning/itching. One small study compared tacrolimus to mometasone furoate, which were both well tolerated, but did not measure investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Â or participantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated control (all based on moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Oral interventions: oral immunosuppressant (a drug that hinders the immune response) cyclosporin probably slightly improves investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Â or participantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated control of good/excellent symptoms compared to topical betamethasone cream (a corticosteroid). The risk of adverse events such as dizziness was similar between groups (all based on moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The oral vitamin A derivative (retinoid) alitretinoin (10 mg) achieved investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated good/excellent symptom control in 307 compared to 194 participants per 1000 with placebo, and alitretinoin 30 mg achieved investigatorÃ¢â‚¬Ârated control in 432 compared to 157 participants per 1000 with placebo. Similar results were shown for participantÃ¢â‚¬Ârated control (highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). When the dosage of alitretinoin was increased to 30 mg, risk of headache was higher compared to placebo (74 versus 251 per 1000; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), but this probably does not differ between alitretinoin 10 mg and placebo (based on moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence).

J2830,2021,P-284 Exploratory magnetic resonance imaging histogram biomarkers for response prediction to neoadjuvant treatment in oesophageal/gastro-oesophageal cancer,"Background: The optimal modality and sequencing of neoadjuvant treatment in gastroesophageal cancer is currently being investigated in clinical trials. Early response biomarkers are needed to guide treatment adaptation. This exploratory analysis of a prospective, non-interventional clinical trial (Magnetic resonance IMaging assessment in OeSophageal cAncer) assessed the potential of histogram T2- and diffusion-weighted imaging biomarkers in response prediction to neoadjuvant treatment in oesophageal cancer. Method(s): Patients with locally advanced T2-4N0-3M0 oesophageal/gastroesophageal squamous cell or adenocarcinoma underwent MRI at baseline (Timepoint_0), in week 3 (Timepoint_1) and on completion of neoadjuvant treatment (Timepoint_2). Free-hand regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on each slice with visible tumour on axial T2-weighted and axial high-b-value (b=800) diffusion-weighted MRI. Gross tumour volume (GTV), maximum tumour diameter (MTD) and 9 histogram features were extracted for the tumour at each timepoint. Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to select features with OR >2 or < 0.5 for the primary outcome of pathological response (Mandard score 1 and 2). Variables which met the cut-off criteria were used to fit multivariate logistic regression models combining clinical variables (age, gender, T-stage and N-stage) with imaging features. Performance of the combined models was compared with that of baseline clinical model and the area under the curve (AUC), and two-tailed p values were reported. Result(s): 37 patients (6 female, 31 male, median 65 years, range 41-80) were included in this analysis. 13/37 patients achieved a pathological response. Diffusion-weighted MTD at Timepoint_1 (OR 0.33, 95%CI 0.14-0.81, p 0.02) and T2-weighted kurtosis at Timepoint_2 (OR 0.09, 95%CI 0.01-0.91, p 0.04) were associated with pathological response. These statistically improved the predictive performance of the clinical model (AUC 0.88 and 0.94, respectively versus 0.75 for baseline clinical model). Conclusion(s): Diffusion-weighted maximal tumour dimension at week-3 and T2-weighted kurtosis on neoadjuvant treatment completion have the potential to improve the predictive value of clinical models for response to treatment, but would require external validation in subsequent studies.

J2833,2021,Mobile phoneÃ¢â‚¬Âbased interventions for improving adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults,"- Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of disability and mortality globally. Premature fatal and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âfatal CVD is considered to be largely preventable through the control of risk factors by lifestyle modifications and preventive medication. LipidÃ¢â‚¬Âlowering and antihypertensive drug therapies for primary prevention are costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffective in reducing CVD morbidity and mortality among highÃ¢â‚¬Ârisk people and are recommended by international guidelines. However, adherence to medication prescribed for the prevention of CVD can be poor. Approximately 9% of CVD cases in the EU are attributed to poor adherence to vascular medications. LowÃ¢â‚¬Âcost, scalable interventions to improve adherence to medications for the primary prevention of CVD have potential to reduce morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs associated with CVD. Objectives To establish the effectiveness of interventions delivered by mobile phone to improve adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD in adults. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases on 7 January 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers on 5 February 2020. We searched reference lists of relevant papers. We applied no language or date restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials investigating interventions delivered wholly or partly by mobile phones to improve adherence to cardiovascular medications prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD. We only included trials with a minimum of oneÃ¢â‚¬Âyear followÃ¢â‚¬Âup in order that the outcome measures related to longerÃ¢â‚¬Âterm, sustained medication adherence behaviours and outcomes. Eligible comparators were usual care or control groups receiving no mobile phoneÃ¢â‚¬Âdelivered component of the intervention. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The main outcomes of interest were objective measures of medication adherence (blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol), CVD events, and adverse events. We contacted study authors for further information when this was not reported. Main results We included 14 trials with 25,633 randomised participants. Participants were recruited from communityÃ¢â‚¬Âbased primary and tertiary care or outpatient clinics. The interventions varied widely from those delivered solely through short messaging service (SMS) to those involving a combination of modes of delivery, such as SMS in addition to healthcare worker training, faceÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âface counselling, electronic pillboxes, written materials, and home blood pressure monitors. Some interventions only targeted medication adherence, while others additionally targeted lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. Due to heterogeneity in the nature and delivery of the interventions and study populations, we reported most results narratively, with the exception of two trials which were similar enough to meaningfully pool in metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalyses. The body of evidence for the effect of mobile phoneÃ¢â‚¬Âbased interventions on objective outcomes of adherence (BP and cholesterol) was of low certainty, due to most trials being at high risk of bias, and inconsistency in outcome effects. Two trials were at low risk of bias. Among five trials (total study enrolment: 5441 participants) recording lowÃ¢â‚¬Âdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLÃ¢â‚¬ÂC), two studies found evidence for a small beneficial intervention effect on reducing LDLÃ¢â‚¬ÂC (Ã¢Ë†â€™5.30 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval (CI) Ã¢Ë†â€™8.30 to Ã¢Ë†â€™2.30; and Ã¢Ë†â€™9.20 mg/dL, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™17.70 to Ã¢Ë†â€™0.70). The other three studies found results varying from a small reduction (Ã¢Ë†â€™7.7 mg/dL) to a small increase in LDLÃ¢â‚¬ÂC (0.77 mg/dL). All of which had wide confidence intervals that included no effect. Across 13 studies (25,166 participants) measuring systolic blood pressure, effect estimates ranged from a large reduction (MD Ã¢Ë†â€™12.45 mmHg, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™15.02 to Ã¢Ë†â€™9.88) to a small increase (MD 2.80 mmHg, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.30). We found a similar range of effect estimates for diastolic BP, ranging from Ã¢Ë†â€™12.23 mmHg (95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™14.03 to Ã¢Ë†â€™10.43) to 1.64 mmHg (95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™0.55 to 3.83) (11 trials, 19,716 participants). Four trials showed intervention benefits for systolic and diastolic BP with confidence intervals excluding no effect, and among these were all three of the trials evaluating selfÃ¢â‚¬Âmonitoring of blood pressure with mobile phoneÃ¢â‚¬Âbased telemedicine. The fourth trial included SMS and provider support (with additional varied features). Seven studies (19,185 participants) reported 'controlled' BP as an outcome, and intervention effect estimates varied from negligible effects (odds ratio (OR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.34) to large improvements in BP control (OR 2.41, 95% CI: 1.57 to 3.68). The three trials of clinician training or decision support combined with SMS (with additional varied features) had confidence intervals encompassing benefits and harms, with point estimates close to zero. Pooled analyses of the two trials of interventions solely delivered through SMS were indicative of little or no beneficial intervention effect on systolic BP (MD Ã¢Ë†â€™1.55 mmHg, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™3.36 to 0.25; I 2 = 0%) and small increases in controlled BP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.65; I 2 = 0%). Based on four studies (12,439 participants), there was very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision and once for risk of bias) relating to the intervention effect on combined (fatal and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âfatal) CVD events. Two studies (2535 participants) provided lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence for the effect of the intervention on cognitive outcomes, with little or no difference between trial arms for perceived quality of care and satisfaction with treatment. There was moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias) that the interventions did not cause harm, based on six studies (8285 participants). Three studies reported no adverse events attributable to the intervention. One study reported no difference between groups in experience of adverse effects of statins, and that no participants reported interventionÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated adverse events. One study stated that potential side effects were similar between groups. One study reported a similar number of deaths in each arm, but did not provide further information relating to potential adverse events. Authors' conclusions There is lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence on the effects of mobile phoneÃ¢â‚¬Âdelivered interventions to increase adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD. Trials of BP selfÃ¢â‚¬Âmonitoring with mobileÃ¢â‚¬Âphone telemedicine support reported modest benefits. One trial at low risk of bias reported modest reductions in LDL cholesterol but no benefits for BP. There is moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence that these interventions do not result in harm. Further trials of these interventions are warranted. Plain language summary Interventions delivered by mobile phone to help people adhere to medication to prevent heart and circulatory disease Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effect of interventions delivered by mobile phone to help people in taking their medication to prevent cardiovascular disease (for example, heart attacks and strokes). Background Around 17.6 million people die from cardiovascular disease every year. Medications can help to prevent cardiovascular disease, but many people who have been given these medications do not take them as often or as consistently as recommended. This means that the medication will not work as well as it could to prevent cardiovascular disease. Interventions delivered through mobile phones, for example, prompting by text messaging, may be a lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcost way to help people to take their medication as recommended. Study characteristics The evidence is up to date to January 2020. We found 14 studies that tested interventions delivered at least partly by mobile phone, which followed up participants for at least 12 months. Key results We were not able to combine the results of most of the trials, because the interventions were very different. Two studies were at low risk of bias and 12 were at high risk of bias. T e effects of the interventions were inconsistent across studies, and so we are not confident about their findings. SelfÃ¢â‚¬Âmonitoring of blood pressure plus telemedicine support by mobile phone may improve blood pressure control, but we are not confident about the findings due to trials being at risk of bias. Interventions delivered by text message alone may have little or no effect on blood pressure control. Interventions which included text messages and clinician training or clinician decision support (with or without additional features) may have little or no effect on blood pressure or cholesterol. The effects of the interventions which included text messages and provider support (with or without other features) were inconsistent across studies, and so we are not confident about their findings. We are uncertain about the effects of apps held by the patient or apps with additional provider support. Some interventions delivered by mobile phone may help people to take their medication, but the benefits are small or modest. Some trials found that the interventions did not have any beneficial effect. There was no evidence to suggest that these types of interventions caused harm.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Study occurs in community-based primary and tertiary care or outpatient clinics.,TRUE,"Appears to be a peer-reviewed article, not a protocol or commentary.",Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,RCT with usual care comparator and clinical outcomes measured.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety']",0.95
J2835,2021,Anticholinergics combined with alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers for treating lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic obstruction,"- Background Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) represent one of the most common clinical complaints in men. AlphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers are widely used as firstÃ¢â‚¬Âline therapy for men with LUTS secondary to BPO, but up to one third of men report no improvement in their LUTS after taking alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers. Anticholinergics used in addition to alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may help improve symptoms but it is uncertain how effective they are. Objectives To assess the effects of combination therapy with anticholinergics and alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers in men with LUTS related to BPO. Search methods We performed a comprehensive search of medical literature, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registries, with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search was 7 August 2020. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials. Inclusion criteria were men with LUTS secondary to BPO, ages 40 years or older, and a total International Prostate Symptom Score of 8 or greater. We excluded trials of men with a known neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or central nervous system disease, and those examining medical therapy for men who were treated with surgery for BPO. We performed three comparisons: combination therapy versus placebo, combination therapy versus alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers monotherapy, and combination therapy versus anticholinergics monotherapy. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We performed statistical analyses using a randomÃ¢â‚¬Âeffects model and interpreted data according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence. Main results We included 23 studies with 6285 randomized men across three comparisons. The mean age of participants ranged from 54.4 years to 73.9 years (overall mean age 65.7 years). Of the included studies, 12 were conducted with a singleÃ¢â‚¬Âcenter setting, while 11 used a multiÃ¢â‚¬Âcenter setting. We only found shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm effect (12 weeks to 12 months) of combination therapy based on available evidence. Combination therapy versus placebo: based on five studies with 2369 randomized participants, combination therapy may result in little or no difference in urologic symptom scores (mean difference (MD) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ5.55 to 0.08; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). We are very uncertain about the effect of combination therapy on quality of life (QoL) (MD Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0.97, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2.11 to 0.16; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Combination therapy likely increases adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.47; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); based on 252 adverse events per 1000 participants in the placebo group, this corresponds to 61 more adverse events (95% CI 10 more to 119 more) per 1000 participants treated with combination therapy. Combination therapy versus alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers alone: based on 22 studies with 4904 randomized participants, we are very uncertain about the effect of combination therapy on urologic symptom scores (MD Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2.04, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3.56 to Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0.52; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and QoL (MD Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0.71, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1.03 to Ã¢â‚¬â€œ0.38; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Combination therapy may result in little or no difference in adverse events rate (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.34; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); based on 228 adverse events per 1000 participants in the alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblocker group, this corresponds to 23 more adverse events (95% CI 23 fewer to 78 more) per 1000 participants treated with combination therapy. Combination therapy compared to anticholinergics alone: based on three studies with 1218 randomized participants, we are very uncertain about the effect of combination therapy on urologic symptom scores (MD Ã¢â‚¬â€œ3.71, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬â€œ9.41 to 1.98; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Combination therapy may result in an improvement in QoL (MD Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1.49, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1.88 to Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1.11; lo Ã¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Combination therapy likely results in little to no difference in adverse events (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.95; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); based on 115 adverse events per 1000 participants in the anticholinergic alone group, this corresponds to 4 fewer adverse events (95% CI 7 fewer to 13 more) per 1000 participants treated with combination therapy. Authors' conclusions Based on the findings of the review, combination therapy with anticholinergics and alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers are associated with little or uncertain effects on urologic symptom scores compared to placebo, alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers, or anticholinergics monotherapy. However, combination therapy may result in an improvement in quality of life compared to anticholinergics monotherapy, but an uncertain effect compared to placebo, or alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers. Combination therapy likely increases adverse events compared to placebo, but not compared to alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers or anticholinergics monotherapy. The findings of this review were limited by study limitations, inconsistency, and imprecision. We were unable to conduct any of the predefined subgroup analyses. Plain language summary Anticholinergics combined with alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers for treating lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic obstruction Review question Is combination therapy with anticholinergics, a type of medicine that can relieve abnormal bladder contraction (where a man cannot control when he urinates), and alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers, a type of medicine that can relax the urethral muscle (the tube that carries urine from the bladder out through the penis during urination), effective and safe for managing urination difficulties and urgency related to enlarged prostate? Background Urination difficulties and urgency caused by enlarged prostate (a male organ near the bladder and surrounding a part of the urethra) are common in men. Although alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers have been used to relieve the urinary symptoms, up to one third of men get no benefit. Combination therapy with alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers and anticholinergics provides a treatment option for men with urinary symptoms. Study characteristics The search is upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate to 7 August 2020. We identified 23 studies involving 6285 men. Five studies compared combination therapy with anticholinergics and alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers versus placebo (a pill with no therapeutic effects). A total of 22 studies compared combination therapy with anticholinergics and alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers versus alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers alone. Three studies compared combination therapy with anticholinergics and alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers versus anticholinergics alone. The followÃ¢â‚¬Âup period in the studies ranged from 12 weeks to one year. Key results Combination therapy versus placebo: combination therapy with anticholinergics and alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers was associated with little effect in urinary symptoms and uncertain improvement on quality of life, but combination therapy may increase unwanted side effects. Combination therapy versus alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers: combination therapy with anticholinergics and alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may have uncertain effects on improvement of urinary symptoms and quality of life compared to alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers alone. Combination therapy may not increase unwanted side effects. Combination therapy compared to anticholinergics: combination therapy with anticholinergics and alphaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers may be associated with uncertain effects on urinary symptoms, but an improvement in quality of life in comparison with anticholinergics alone. Combination therapy may not increase unwanted side effects.

J2841,2021,"Withdrawal or continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine or both, in people with dementia","- Background Dementia is a progressive syndrome characterised by deterioration in memory, thinking and behaviour, and by impaired ability to perform daily activities. Two classes of drug Ã¢â‚¬Â cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine) and memantine Ã¢â‚¬Â are widely licensed for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, and rivastigmine is also licensed for Parkinson's disease dementia. These drugs are prescribed to alleviate symptoms and delay disease progression in these and sometimes in other forms of dementia. There are uncertainties about the benefits and adverse effects of these drugs in the long term and in severe dementia, about effects of withdrawal, and about the most appropriate time to discontinue treatment. Objectives To evaluate the effects of withdrawal or continuation of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or both, in people with dementia on: cognitive, neuropsychiatric and functional outcomes, rates of institutionalisation, adverse events, dropout from trials, mortality, quality of life and carerÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement GroupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Specialised Register up to 17 October 2020 using terms appropriate for the retrieval of studies of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine. The Specialised Register contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases, numerous trial registries and grey literature sources. Selection criteria We included all randomised, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) which compared withdrawal of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine, or both, with continuation of the same drug or drugs. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed citations and fullÃ¢â‚¬Âtext articles for inclusion, extracted data from included trials and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Where trials were sufficiently similar, we pooled data for outcomes in the short term (up to 2 months after randomisation), medium term (3Ã¢â‚¬Â11 months) and long term (12 months or more). We assessed the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. Main results We included six trials investigating cholinesterase inhibitor withdrawal, and one trial investigating withdrawal of either donepezil or memantine. No trials assessed withdrawal of memantine only. Drugs were withdrawn abruptly in five trials and stepwise in two trials. All participants had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, with severities ranging from mild to very severe, and were taking cholinesterase inhibitors without known adverse effects at baseline. The included trials randomised 759 participants to treatment groups relevant to this review. Study duration ranged from 6 weeks to 12 months. There were too few included studies to allow planned subgroup analyses. We considered some studies to be at unclear or high risk of selection, performance, detection, attrition or reporting bias. Compared to continuing cholinesterase inhibitors, discontinuing treatment may be associated with worse cognitive function in the short term (standardised mean difference (SMD) Ã¢â‚¬Â0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) Ã¢â‚¬Â0.64 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.21; 4 studies; low certainty), but the effect in the medium term is very uncertain (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.40, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.87 to 0.07; 3 studies; very low certainty). In a sensitivity analysis omitting data from a study which only included participants who had shown a relatively poor prior response to donepezil, inconsistency was reduced and we found that cognitive function may be worse in the discontinuation group in the medium term (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.62; 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.94 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.31). Data from one longerÃ¢â‚¬Âterm study suggest that discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor is probably associated with worse cognitive function at 12 months (mean difference (MD) Ã¢â‚¬Â2.09 Standardised MiniÃ¢â‚¬ÂMental State Examination (SMMSE) points, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â3.43 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.75; moderate certainty). Discontinuation may make little or no difference to functional status in the short term (SM Ã¢â‚¬Â0.25, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.54 to 0.04; 2 studies; low certainty), and its effect in the medium term is uncertain (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.38, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.74 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.01; 2 studies; very low certainty). After 12 months, discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor probably results in greater functional impairment than continuing treatment (MD Ã¢â‚¬Â3.38 Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS) points, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â6.67 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.10; one study; moderate certainty). Discontinuation may be associated with a worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms over the short term and medium term, although we cannot exclude a minimal effect (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â 0.48, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.82 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.13; 2 studies; low certainty; and SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.27, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.47 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.08; 3 studies; low certainty, respectively). Data from one study suggest that discontinuing a cholinesterase inhibitor may result in little to no change in neuropsychiatric status at 12 months (MD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.87 Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) points; 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â8.42 to 6.68; moderate certainty). We found no clear evidence of an effect of discontinuation on dropout due to lack of medication efficacy or deterioration in overall medical condition (odds ratio (OR) 1.53, 95% CI 0.84 to 2.76; 4 studies; low certainty), on number of adverse events (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.27; 4 studies; low certainty) or serious adverse events (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.39; 4 studies; low certainty), and on mortality (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.55; 5 studies; low certainty). Institutionalisation was reported in one trial, but it was not possible to extract data for the groups relevant to this review. Authors' conclusions This review suggests that discontinuing cholinesterase inhibitors may result in worse cognitive, neuropsychiatric and functional status than continuing treatment, although this is supported by limited evidence, almost all of low or very low certainty. As all participants had dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, our findings are not transferable to other dementia types. We were unable to determine whether the effects of discontinuing cholinesterase inhibitors differed with baseline dementia severity. There is currently no evidence to guide decisions about discontinuing memantine. There is a need for further wellÃ¢â‚¬Âdesigned RCTs, across a range of dementia severities and settings. We are aware of two ongoing registered trials. In making decisions about discontinuing these drugs, clinicians should exercise caution, considering the evidence from existing trials along with other factors important to patients and their carers. Plain language summary Stopping or continuing antiÃ¢â‚¬Âdementia drugs in patients with dementia Background Dementia is the term used to describe a group of illnesses, usually developing in late life, in which there is a deterioration in a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to think, remember, communicate and manage daily activities independently. It can be caused by several different brain diseases, but the most common form is dementia due to AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease. At the moment, there are no medical treatments which can prevent dementia or stop it from progressing, but there are two classes of drugs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine) and memantine Ã¢â‚¬Â which are approved and widely prescribed to treat some of the symptoms. They are used mainly for dementia due to Alzheimer's disease but also sometimes for other types of dementia. Most of the trials studying the effects of these drugs have been quite short (typically six months) even though dementia usually lasts for years. The drugs can have unwanted side effects in some people. There is uncertainty about their longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm effects and about how useful they are for severe dementia, with different countries making different recommendations. Therefore it can be difficult for doctors and patients to decide if and when these drugs should be stopped once they have been started. What was the aim of this review? In this review, we aimed to summarise the best evidence about whether stopping cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine was beneficial or harmfu to people with dementia who had been taking them for at least two months. What we did We searched up to October 2020 for trials which had: recruited people with dementia who were taking a cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine, or both; divided them randomly into a group of patients who continued treatment and a group of patients who stopped treatment; and compared what happened in the two groups. What we found We found seven trials (759 participants) to include in the review. All of the participants had dementia due to AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease, but in some trials, the disease was mild to moderate and in others, it was moderate to severe or very severe. Six trials investigated the effects of stopping a cholinesterase inhibitor and one trial investigated stopping either a cholinesterase inhibitor (specifically, donepezil) or memantine. We decided not to pool its results with the other six trials. Effects were measured over different periods of time in different trials. We looked separately at effects in the first 2 months (short term), between 3 and 11 months (medium term), and after a year or more (long term). When we looked at the effect on thinking skills and memory, we found that, compared to stopping treatment, continuing treatment with a cholinesterase inhibitor may be beneficial in the short term and medium term and is probably beneficial in the long term. For ability to carry out daily activities, there may be little or no effect in the short term, and the effect in the medium term was very uncertain, but there is probably a benefit to continuing treatment over the longer term. For mood and behavioural problems, continuing treatment may have benefits in the short term and medium term, but not in the long term. We found no clear evidence about the effects of stopping these drugs on patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ physical health or risk of dying. There was very little evidence about effects on quality of life or on the likelihood of moving to a care home to live. There was not enough evidence for us to see whether results differed with the severity of dementia. Our certainty in the results varied from moderate to very low, mainly because of small numbers of trials and participants, some problems with the way the trials were conducted, and imprecise statistical results. Our conclusions Although there was uncertainty about the results, most of the evidence pointed to benefits of continuing treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors. There was no evidence about types of dementia other than AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease, and we were unable to draw specific conclusions about continuing or stopping treatment at different stages of the illness. We found no trials that just investigated stopping memantine. These results may help patients and their doctors to make decisions about whether or not to continue treatment, although other factors, such as side effects in an individual patient and the patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s preferences, are also important.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,"Study involves dementia drug withdrawal, likely in NHS or community settings.",TRUE,Peer-reviewed article from Cochrane review.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,RCT with comparator and clinical outcomes,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety', 'pro']",0.95
J2842,2021,A case management occupational health model to facilitate earlier return to work of NHS staff with common mental health disorders: A feasibility study,"Background: The NHS is the biggest employer in the UK. Depression and anxiety are common reasons for sickness absence among staff. Evidence suggests that an intervention based on a case management model using a biopsychosocial approach could be cost-effective and lead to earlier return to work for staff with common mental health disorders. Objective(s): The objective was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a trial of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an early occupational health referral and case management intervention to facilitate the return to work of NHS staff on sick leave with any common mental health disorder (e.g. depression or anxiety). Design(s): A multicentre mixed-methods feasibility study with embedded process evaluation and economic analyses. The study comprised an updated systematic review, survey of care as usual, and development of an intervention in consultation with key stakeholders. Although this was not a randomised controlled trial, the study design comprised two arms where participants received either the intervention or care as usual. Participant(s): Participants were NHS staff on sick leave for 7 or more consecutive days but less than 90 consecutive days, with a common mental health disorder. Intervention(s): The intervention involved early referral to occupational health combined with standardised work-focused case management.

J2843,2021,Organising Support for Carers of Stroke Survivors (OSCARSS): a cluster randomised controlled trial with economic evaluation,"Objective Investigated clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a person-centred intervention for informal carers/caregivers of stroke survivors. Design Pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) with economic and process evaluation. Setting Clusters were services, from a UK voluntary sector specialist provider, delivering support primarily in the homes of stroke survivors and informal carers. Participants Adult carers in participating clusters were referred to the study by cluster staff following initial support contact. Interventions Intervention was the Carer Support Needs Assessment Tool for Stroke: a staff-facilitated, carer-led approach to help identify, prioritise and address the specific support needs of carers. It required at least one face-to-face support contact dedicated to carers, with reviews as required. Control was usual care, which included carer support (unstructured and variable). Outcome measures Participants provided study entry and self-reported outcome data by postal questionnaires, 3 and 6 months after first contact by cluster staff. Primary Outcome: 3-month caregiver strain (Family Appraisal of Caregiving Questionnaire, FACQ). Secondary Outcomes: FACQ subscales of caregiver distress and positive appraisals of caregiving, mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and satisfaction with stroke services (Pound). The economic evaluation included self-reported healthcare utilisation, intervention costs and EQ-5D-5L. Randomisation and masking Clusters were recruited before randomisation to intervention or control, with stratification for size of service. Cluster staff could not be masked as training was required for participation. Carer research participants provided self-reported outcome data unaware of allocation; they consented to follow-up data collection only. Results Between 1 February 2017 and 31 July 2018, 35 randomised clusters (18 intervention; 17 control) recruited 414 cRCT carers (208 intervention; 206 control). Study entry characteristics were well balanced. Primary outcome measure: intention-to-treat analysis for 84% retained participants (175 intervention; 174 control) found mean (SD) FACQ carer strain at 3 months to be 3.11 (0.87) in the control group compared with 3.03 (0.90) in the intervention group, adjusted mean difference of -0.04 (95% CI -0.20 to 0.13). Secondary outcomes had similarly small differences and tight CIs. Sensitivity analyses suggested robust findings. Intervention fidelity was not achieved. Intervention-related group costs were marginally higher with no additional health benefit observed on EQ-5D-5L. No adverse events were related to the intervention. Conclusions The intervention was not fully implemented in this pragmatic trial. As delivered, it conferred no clinical benefits and is unlikely to be cost-effective compared with usual care from a stroke specialist provider organisation. It remains unclear how best to support carers of stroke survivors. To overcome the implementation challenges of person-centred care in carers' research and service development, staff training and organisational support would need to be enhanced.

J2844,2021,1-year cost-utility analysis of prostate artery embolization (PAE) versus transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH),"Objective To determine whether prostate artery embolization (PAE) is a cost-effective alternative to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in the management of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) after 1-year follow-up. Design, setting and main outcome measures A retrospective cost-utility analysis over a 12-month time period was conducted to compare the two interventions from a National Health Service perspective. Effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from data collected during the observational UK Register of Prostate Embolisation (UK-ROPE) Study. Costs for both PAE and TURP were derived from University Hospital Southampton, a tertiary referral centre for BPH and the largest contributor to the UK-ROPE. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was derived from cost and QALY values associated with both interventions to assess the cost-effectiveness of PAE versus TURP. Further sensitivity analyses involved a decision tree model to account for the impact of patient-reported complications on the cost-effectiveness of the interventions. Results The mean patient age for TURP (n=31) and PAE (n=133) was 69 and 65.6 years, respectively. In comparison to TURP, PAE was cheaper due to shorter patient stays and the lack of necessity for an operating theatre. Analysis revealed an ICER of 64 798.10 saved per QALY lost when comparing PAE to TURP after 1-year follow-up. Conclusion Our findings suggest that PAE is initially a cost-effective alternative to TURP for the management of BPH after 1-year follow-up. Due to a higher reintervention rate in the PAE group, this benefit may be lost in subsequent years. Trial registration number NCT02434575.

J2848,2021,Cost Effectiveness of Ranibizumab vs Aflibercept vs Bevacizumab for the Treatment of Macular Oedema Due to Central Retinal Vein Occlusion: The LEAVO Study,"Background: We aimed to assess the cost effectiveness of intravitreal ranibizumab (Lucentis), aflibercept (Eylea) and bevacizumab (Avastin) for the treatment of macular oedema due to central retinal vein occlusion. Method(s): We calculated costs and quality-adjusted life-years from the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. We performed a within-trial analysis using the efficacy, safety, resource use and health utility data from a randomised controlled trial (LEAVO) over 100 weeks. We built a discrete event simulation to model long-term outcomes. We estimated utilities using the Visual-Functioning Questionnaire-Utility Index, EQ-5D and EQ-5D with an additional vision question. We used standard UK costs sources for 2018/19 and a cost of 28 per bevacizumab injection. We discounted costs and quality-adjusted life-years at 3.5% annually. Result(s): Bevacizumab was the least costly intervention followed by ranibizumab and aflibercept in both the within-trial analysis (bevacizumab: 6292, ranibizumab: 13,014, aflibercept: 14,328) and long-term model (bevacizumab: 18,353, ranibizumab: 30,226, aflibercept: 35,026). Although LEAVO did not demonstrate bevacizumab to be non-inferior for the visual acuity primary outcome, the three interventions generated similar quality-adjusted life-years in both analyses. Bevacizumab was always the most cost-effective intervention at a threshold of 30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, even using the list price of 243 per injection. Conclusion(s): Wider adoption of bevacizumab for the treatment of macular oedema due to central retinal vein occlusion could result in substantial savings to healthcare systems and deliver similar health-related quality of life. However, patients, funders and ophthalmologists should be fully aware that LEAVO could not demonstrate that bevacizumab is non-inferior to the licensed agents.

J2849,2021,Systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical utility of enhanced recovery after surgery pathways in adult spine surgery,"OBJECTIVE Spine surgery has been identified as a significant source of healthcare expenditures in the United States. Prolonged hospitalization has been cited as one source of increased spending, and there has been drive from providers and payors alike to decrease inpatient stays. One strategy currently being explored is the use of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols. Here, the authors review the literature on adult spine ERAS protocols, focusing on clinical benefits and cost reductions. They also conducted a quantitative meta-analysis examining the following: 1) length of stay (LOS), 2) complication rate, 3) wound infection rate, 4) 30-day readmission rate, and 5) 30-day reoperation rate. METHODS Using the PRISMA guidelines, a search of the PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Reviews, Embase, CINAHL, and OVID Medline databases was conducted to identify all full-text articles in the English-language literature describing ERAS protocol implementation for adult spine surgery. A quantitative meta-analysis using random-effects modeling was performed for the identified clinical outcomes using studies that directly compared ERAS protocols with conventional care. RESULTS Of 950 articles reviewed, 34 were included in the qualitative analysis and 20 were included in the quantitative analysis. The most common protocol types were general spine surgery protocols and protocols for lumbar spine surgery patients. The most frequently cited benefits of ERAS protocols were shorter LOS (n = 12), lower postoperative pain scores (n = 6), and decreased complication rates (n = 4). The meta-analysis demonstrated shorter LOS for the general spine surgery (mean difference -1.22 days [95% CI -1.98 to -0.47]) and lumbar spine ERAS protocols (-1.53 days [95% CI -2.89 to -0.16]). Neither general nor lumbar spine protocols led to a significant difference in complication rates. Insufficient data existed to perform a meta-analysis of the differences in costs or postoperative narcotic use. CONCLUSIONS Present data suggest that ERAS protocol implementation may reduce hospitalization time among adult spine surgery patients and may lead to reductions in complication rates when applied to specific populations. To generate high-quality evidence capable of supporting practice guidelines, though, additional controlled trials are necessary to validate these early findings in larger populations.

J2850,2021,Long-term monitoring in primary care for chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure: a multi-method research programme,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: Long-term monitoring is important in chronic condition management. Despite considerable costs of monitoring, there is no or poor evidence on how, what and when to monitor. The aim of this study was to improve understanding, methods, evidence base and practice of clinical monitoring in primary care, focusing on two areas: chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure.
<b>OBJECTIVES</b>: The research questions were as follows: does the choice of test affect better care while being affordable to the NHS? Can the number of tests used to manage individuals with early-stage kidney disease, and hence the costs, be reduced? Is it possible to monitor heart failure using a simple blood test? Can this be done using a rapid test in a general practitioner consultation? Would changes in the management of these conditions be acceptable to patients and carers?
<b>DESIGN</b>: Various study designs were employed, including cohort, feasibility study, Clinical Practice Research Datalink analysis, seven systematic reviews, two qualitative studies, one cost-effectiveness analysis and one cost recommendation.
<b>SETTING</b>: This study was set in UK primary care.
<b>DATA SOURCES</b>: Data were collected from study participants and sourced from UK general practice and hospital electronic health records, and worldwide literature.
<b>PARTICIPANTS</b>: The participants were NHS patients (Clinical Practice Research Datalink: 4.5 million patients), chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure patients managed in primary care (including 750 participants in the cohort study) and primary care health professionals.
<b>INTERVENTIONS</b>: The interventions were monitoring with blood and urine tests (for chronic kidney disease) and monitoring with blood tests and weight measurement (for chronic heart failure).
<b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</b>: The main outcomes were the frequency, accuracy, utility, acceptability, costs and cost-effectiveness of monitoring.
<b>RESULTS</b>: Chronic kidney disease: serum creatinine testing has increased steadily since 1997, with most results being normal (83% in 2013). Increases in tests of creatinine and proteinuria correspond to their introduction as indicators in the Quality and Outcomes Framework. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation had 2.7% greater accuracy (95% confidence interval 1.6% to 3.8%) than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation for estimating glomerular filtration rate. Estimated annual transition rates to the next chronic kidney disease stage are = 2% for people with normal urine albumin, 3-5% for people with microalbuminuria (3-30 mg/mmol) and 3-12% for people with macroalbuminuria (> 30 mg/mmol). Variability in estimated glomerular filtration rate-creatinine leads to misclassification of chronic kidney disease stage in 12-15% of tests in primary care. Glycaemic-control and lipid-modifying drugs are associated with a 6% (95% confidence interval 2% to 10%) and 4% (95% confidence interval 0% to 8%) improvement in renal function, respectively. Neither estimated glomerular filtration rate-creatinine nor estimated glomerular filtration rate-Cystatin C have utility in predicting rate of kidney function change. Patients viewed phrases such as 'kidney damage' or 'kidney failure' as frightening, and the term 'chronic' was misinterpreted as serious. Diagnosis of asymptomatic conditions (chronic kidney disease) was difficult to understand, and primary care professionals often did not use 'chronic kidney disease' when managing patients at early stages. General practitioners relied on Clinical Commissioning Group or Quality and Outcomes Framework alerts rather than National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance for information. Cost-effectiveness modelling did not demonstrate a tangible benefit of monitoring kidney function to guide preventative treatments, except for individuals with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60-90 ml/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, aged < 70 years and without cardiovascular disease, where monitoring every 3-4 years to guide cardiovascular prevention may be cost-effective. Chronic heart failure: natriuretic peptide-guided treatment could reduce all-cause mortality by 13% and heart failure admission by 20%. Implementing natriuretic peptide-guided treatment is likely to require predefined protocols, stringent natriuretic peptide targets, relative targets and being located in a specialist heart failure setting. Remote monitoring can reduce all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalisation, and could improve quality of life. Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (sensitivity, 0.99; specificity, 0.60) was better than point-of-care B-type natriuretic peptide (sensitivity, 0.95; specificity, 0.57). Within-person variation estimates for B-type natriuretic peptide and weight were as follows: coefficient of variation, 46% and coefficient of variation, 1.2%, respectively. Point-of-care N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide within-person variability over 12 months was 881 pg/ml (95% confidence interval 380 to 1382 pg/ml), whereas between-person variability was 1972 pg/ml (95% confidence interval 1525 to 2791 pg/ml). For individuals, monitoring provided reassurance; future changes, such as increased testing, would be acceptable. Point-of-care testing in general practice surgeries was perceived positively, reducing waiting time and anxiety. Community heart failure nurses had greater knowledge of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance than general practitioners and practice nurses. Health-care professionals believed that the cost of natriuretic peptide tests in routine monitoring would outweigh potential benefits. The review of cost-effectiveness studies suggests that natriuretic peptide-guided treatment is cost-effective in specialist settings, but with no evidence for its value in primary care settings.
<b>LIMITATIONS</b>: No randomised controlled trial evidence was generated. The pathways to the benefit of monitoring chronic kidney disease were unclear.
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: It is difficult to ascribe quantifiable benefits to monitoring chronic kidney disease, because monitoring is unlikely to change treatment, especially in chronic kidney disease stages G3 and G4. New approaches to monitoring chronic heart failure, such as point-of-care natriuretic peptide tests in general practice, show promise if high within-test variability can be overcome.
<b>FUTURE WORK</b>: The following future work is recommended: improve general practitioner-patient communication of early-stage renal function decline, and identify strategies to reduce the variability of natriuretic peptide.

J2852,2021,Adrenaline to improve survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: The PARAMEDIC2 RCT,"Background: Adrenaline has been used as a treatment for cardiac arrest for many years, despite uncertainty about its effects on long-term outcomes and concerns that it may cause worse neurological outcomes. Objective(s): The objectives were to evaluate the effects of adrenaline on survival and neurological outcomes, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of adrenaline use. Design(s): This was a pragmatic, randomised, allocation-concealed, placebo-controlled, parallel-group superiority trial and economic evaluation. Costs are expressed in Great British pounds and reported in 2016/17 prices. Setting(s): This trial was set in five NHS ambulance services in England and Wales. Participant(s): Adults treated for an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were included. Patients were ineligible if they were pregnant, if they were aged < 16 years, if the cardiac arrest had been caused by anaphylaxis or life-threatening asthma, or if adrenaline had already been given. Intervention(s): Participants were randomised to either adrenaline (1 mg) or placebo in a 1: 1 allocation ratio by the opening of allocation-concealed treatment packs. Main Outcome Measure(s): The primary outcome was survival to 30 days. The secondary outcomes were survival to hospital admission, survival to hospital discharge, survival at 3, 6 and 12 months, neurological outcomes and health-related quality of life through to 6 months. The economic evaluation assessed the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services. Participants, clinical teams and those assessing patient outcomes were masked to the treatment allocation. Result(s): From December 2014 to October 2017, 8014 participants were assigned to the adrenaline (n = 4015) or to the placebo (n = 3999) arm. At 30 days, 130 out of 4012 participants (3.2%) in the adrenaline arm and 94 out of 3995 (2.4%) in the placebo arm were alive (adjusted odds ratio for survival 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.97). For secondary outcomes, survival to hospital admission was higher for those receiving adrenaline than for those receiving placebo (23.6% vs. 8.0%; adjusted odds ratio 3.83, 95% confidence interval 3.30 to 4.43). The rate of favourable neurological outcome at hospital discharge was not significantly different between the arms (2.2% vs. 1.9%; adjusted odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.68). The pattern of improved survival but no significant improvement in neurological outcomes continued through to 6 months. By 12 months, survival in the adrenaline arm was 2.7%, compared with 2.0% in the placebo arm (adjusted odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.92). An adjusted subgroup analysis did not identify significant interactions. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for adrenaline was estimated at 1,693,003 per quality-adjusted life-year gained over the first 6 months after the cardiac arrest event and 81,070 per quality-adjusted life-year gained over the lifetime of survivors. Additional economic analyses estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for adrenaline at 982,880 per percentage point increase in overall survival and 377,232 per percentage point increase in neurological outcomes over the first 6 months after the cardiac arrest. Limitation(s): The estimate for survival with a favourable neurological outcome is imprecise because of the small numbers of patients surviving with a good outcome. Conclusion(s): Adrenaline improved long-term survival, but there was no evidence that it significantly improved neurological outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year exceeds the threshold of 20,000-30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year usually supported by the NHS. Future work: Further research is required to better understand patients' preferences in relation to survival and neurological outcomes after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and to aid interpretation of the trial findings from a patient and public perspective.

J2853,2021,Rehabilitation following surgery for flexor tendon injuries of the hand,"- Background Various rehabilitation treatments may be offered following surgery for flexor tendon injuries of the hand. Rehabilitation often includes a combination of an exercise regimen and an orthosis, plus other rehabilitation treatments, usually delivered together. The effectiveness of these interventions remains unclear. Objectives To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of different rehabilitation interventions after surgery for flexor tendon injuries of the hand. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, two additional databases and two international trials registries, unrestricted by language. The last date of searches was 11 August 2020. We checked the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasiÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCTs that compared any postoperative rehabilitation intervention with no intervention, control, placebo, or another postoperative rehabilitation intervention in individuals who have had surgery for flexor tendon injuries of the hand. Trials comparing different mobilisation regimens either with another mobilisation regimen or with a control were the main comparisons of interest. Our main outcomes of interest were patientÃ¢â‚¬Âreported function, active range of motion of the fingers, and number of participants experiencing an adverse event. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, assessed risk of bias and assessed the quality of the body of evidence for primary outcomes using the GRADE approach, according to standard Cochrane methodology. Main results We included 16 RCTs and one quasiÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCT, with a total of 1108 participants, mainly adults. Overall, the participants were aged between 7 and 72 years, and 74% were male. Studies mainly focused on flexor tendon injuries in zone II. The 17 studies were heterogeneous with respect to the types of rehabilitation treatments provided, intensity, duration of treatment and the treatment setting. Each trial tested one of 14 comparisons, eight of which were of different exercise regimens. The other trials examined the timing of return to unrestricted functional activities after surgery (one study); the use of external devices applied to the participant to facilitate mobilisation, such as an exoskeleton (one study) or continuous passive motion device (one study); modalities such as laser therapy (two studies) or ultrasound therapy (one study); and a motor imagery treatment (one study). No trials tested different types of orthoses; different orthosis wearing regimens, including duration; different timings for commencing mobilisation; different types of scar management; or different timings for commencing strengthening. Trials were generally at high risk of bias for one or more domains, including lack of blinding, incomplete outcome data and selective outcome reporting. Data pooling was limited to tendon rupture data in a three trial comparison. We rated the evidence available for all reported outcomes of all comparisons as very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, which means that we have very little confidence in the estimates of effect. We present the findings from three exercise regimen comparisons, as these are commonly used in clinical current practice. Early active flexion plus controlled passive exercise regimen versus early controlled passive exercise regimen (modified Kleinert protocol) was compared in one trial of 53 participants with mainly zone II flexor tendon repairs. There is very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence of no clinically important difference between the two groups in patientÃ¢â‚¬Ârated function or active finger range of motion at 6 or 12 months followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. There is very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence of little betweenÃ¢â‚¬Âgroup difference in adverse events: there were 15 overall. All three tendon ruptures underwent secondary surgery. An active exercise regimen versus an immobilisation egimen for three weeks was compared in one trial reporting data for 84 participants with zone II flexor tendon repairs. The trial did not report on selfÃ¢â‚¬Ârated function, on range of movement during three to six months or numbers of participants experiencing adverse events. The very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence for poor (under oneÃ¢â‚¬Âquarter that of normal) range of finger movement at one to three years followÃ¢â‚¬Âup means we are uncertain of the finding of zero cases in the active group versus seven cases in the immobilisation regimen. The same uncertainty applies to the finding of little difference between the two groups in adverse events (5 tendon ruptures in the active group versus 10 probable scar adhesion in the immobilisation group) indicated for surgery. Place and hold exercise regimen performed within an orthosis versus a controlled passive regimen using rubber band traction was compared in three heterogeneous trials, which reported data for a maximum of 194 participants, with mainly zone II flexor tendon repairs. The trials did not report on range of movement during three to six months, or numbers of participants experiencing adverse events. There was very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence of no difference in selfÃ¢â‚¬Ârated function using the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) functional assessment between the two groups at six months (one trial) or at 12 months (one trial). There is very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence from one trial of greater active finger range of motion at 12 months after place and hold. Secondary surgery data were not available; however, all seven recorded tendon ruptures would have required surgery. All the evidence for the other five exercise comparisons as well as those of the other six comparisons made by the included studies was incomplete and, where available, of very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty. Authors' conclusions There is a lack of evidence from RCTs on most of the rehabilitation interventions used following surgery for flexor tendon injuries of the hand. The limited and very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence for all 14 comparisons examined in the 17 included studies means that we have very little confidence in the estimates of effect for all outcomes for which data were available for these comparisons. The dearth of evidence identified in this review points to the urgent need for sufficiently powered RCTs that examine key questions relating to the rehabilitation of these injuries. A consensus approach identifying these and establishing minimum study conduct and reporting criteria will be valuable. Our suggestions for future research are detailed in the review. Plain language summary What are the best ways for recovering movement in the hand after surgery to repair flexor tendons (tendons in the hand that enable fingers to bend)? Why is this question important? Flexor tendons are strong smooth cords that connect the muscles in the forearm (between the hand and elbow) to the bones in the fingers. These tendons allow us to bend our fingers. (Other tendons, known as extensor tendons, allow us to straighten them.) If flexor tendons become damaged Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for example, because of a deep cut from broken glass Ã¢â‚¬â€œ surgery is usually needed. The aim of surgery is to repair the tendons so that movement can be restored in the affected fingers. After surgery, the tendons need a lengthy period of rehabilitation to recover from the injury, the surgery and to restore movement. This period typically lasts 12 weeks, though it can be longer for people with complex injuries or with complications such as joint deformities. Rehabilitation usually involves several different steps. After surgery, people often must wear a splint or other devise to stabilise or immobilise the hand and wrist. They also often must do hand exercises to stop the repaired tendons from sticking to surrounding tissue and limiting hand movement. There are many kinds of different rehabilitation programmes, but it is unclear whether some are better than others. We set out to review the evidence from research studies, to find out: Ã¢â‚¬Â which approaches are most effect ve in restoring finger motion and function; and Ã¢â‚¬Â which approaches minimise the risk of adverse (unwanted) events, such as tendon ruptures, scar tissue sticking to other tissues, and joint stiffness. How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? First, we searched for studies in the medical literature that compared any rehabilitation approach after flexor tendon surgery against: Ã¢â‚¬Â no treatment; Ã¢â‚¬Â a placebo (dummy) treatment (in which, for example, someone thinks they may be receiving laser therapy but the machine is switched off); or Ã¢â‚¬Â another rehabilitation approach. We then compared the results, and summarised the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies that tested the same comparison. What did we find? We found 17 studies that involved a total of 1108 people who had received surgery to repair torn flexor tendons. The people were aged between 7 and 72 years, and threeÃ¢â‚¬Âquarters of them were male. Ten studies evaluated one each of eight different hand exercise programmes. The other seven studies evaluated a variety of other rehabilitation approaches, such as: Ã¢â‚¬Â laser therapy, in which light is directed at the tendons to encourage healing; Ã¢â‚¬Â ultrasound, in which sound waves are directed at the tendons to encourage healing; and Ã¢â‚¬Â a wearable machine (exoskeleton), designed to assist people in their movements. We found very little evidence about the benefits and risks of different rehabilitation approaches. The evidence we did find was not robust. For example, for the three most relevant exercise comparisons we identified only: Ã¢â‚¬Â one study (84 people) that compared finger exercises against immobilisation; Ã¢â‚¬Â one study (53 people) that evaluated the effects of adding regular finger exercises (20 to 30 times every waking hour for four weeks from the first day after surgery) to Ã¢â‚¬ËœpassiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ exercises (in which people regularly folded the fingers in the injured hand using the uninjured hand); and Ã¢â‚¬Â three studies (190 people) that evaluated the effects of adding Ã¢â‚¬Ëœplace and holdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ exercises (during which people use their uninjured hand to fold the fingers of the injured hand, and then have to hold the folded fingers in place for a few seconds without any support) to passive exercises. The studies were too small, or reported too little robust or usable information, for us to determine which approach is best. What does this mean? We do not know which method works best for people to recover movement in the hand after surgery to repair flexor tendons. This is because there is not enough robust evidence about the benefits and risks of different methods. Further research is needed to help inform cliniciansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ choice of rehabilitation after surgery for flexor tendon injuries. How upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate is this review?

J2855,2021,Carbapenemase-producing organism (CPO) colonisation at a district general hospital: universal screening may help reduce transmission,"Objective: Assess the potential of hospital-wide routine screening by determining the prevalence and incidence of carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) isolated from rectal screens at Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals. Method(s): 3,553 samples were collected between 01/12/2018 and 31/08/2019: from adult critical care wards (universal screening - admission, discharge and weekly), from medical wards with risk-factor based screening according to the prevailing Public Health England (PHE) carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) screening guidelines, or on an ad hoc basis. Prevalence was defined as previously documented positive CPO colonisation, or new positive status, as a proportion of all eligible samples. Incidence was defined as all newly positive patients per 1,000 patient-days. Result(s): Overall CPO prevalence was 2.1% (95% CI: 1.61-2.58%). Inpatient prevalence was significantly higher at 2.6% vs outpatient at 0.5% (p < 0.001). Incidence was 0.44 per 1,000 patient-days (95% CI: 0.33-0.57), with a rate ratio between Barnet and Chase Farm of 4.9 (p = 0.013). Incidence was highest where universal screening strategy was applied (3.9 per 1000 patient-days, 95% CI: 2.4-5.91). This was 2.5 times higher than risk-factor based screening (p = 0.005) and 23.5 times that of wards without routine surveillance implemented (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Surveillance remains a cornerstone in controlling CPO transmission. Our local incidence, lacking hospital-wide screening, significantly exceeded the reported UK average. Universal screening could help to uncover the true prevalence and incidence of CPO, thereby providing the necessary information to properly control transmission, reducing nosocomial outbreaks and ultimately reducing the overall cost to healthcare.

J2856,2021,Results of the avoiding late diagnosis of ovarian cancer (ALDO) project; A pilot national surveillance program for brca mutationcarriers,"Introduction/Background * Ovarian cancer (OC) in BRCA mutation-carriers is typically diagnosed clinically at >=stage 3c, with consequent poor prognosis. Risk-reducing salpingooophorectomy (RRSO) is recommended for BRCA mutationcarriers as the only proven method of OC prevention. Women who defer RRSO to permit child-bearing/prevent premature menopause would benefit from surveillance which can downstage OC occurring prior to RRSO. We wanted to establish the 'real world' performance of OC surveillance which we have previously shown downstages OC in clinical trials. Methodology 875 female BRCA mutation-carriers were recruited at 13 UK centres and via a media campaign and underwent 4-monthly surveillance with the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) blood test. They had a 6 week repeat test if their ROCA score was >1 in 1000, and a transvaginal scan (TVS) in addition, if their risk was > 1 in 500. Women with a score >1 in 33 or those with concerning TVS were referred to a rapid access clinic to rule out OC. RRSO was encouraged throughout the program. Participants were followed via questionnaires, notification by centres/GPs and direct contact. Surveillance performance was calculated after censoring 4 months after prior screen, with modelling of occult cancers detected at RRSO. Incremental cost-effectiveness was calculated using a Markov population cohort simulation. Result(s)* 8 OCs occurred during 1277 women screen years; 2 occult OCs at RRSO (both stage 1a), 6 screen-detected OCs (3 prevalent; stage 2a, 3aii and 3c, 3 incident; stage 1a, 3b and 4b). 4 of 6 (67%) screen-detected OCs were diagnosed at stages <3c. 7 of 8 (87.5%) screen-detected cancers were completely cytoreduced. There were no interval cancers. Modelled sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for OC were 87.5% (CI, 47.3-99.7), 99.9%(99.9-100), 75%(34.9-96.8) and 99.9% (99.9-100) respectively. Economic modelling indicated that surveillance would be cost-saving within the UK National Health Service. Conclusion* OC surveillance for women declining RRSO in a 'real-word' setting is feasible and equally effective as in research trials, resulting in successful downstaging with likely clinical benefit and healthcare cost savings. Whilst RRSO remains the recommended management for BRCA-carriers, ROCA-based surveillance is a viable interim option for those who defer such surgery.",TRUE,Study conducted at 13 UK centres and involves NHS.,TRUE,"Study conducted in UK centres, likely NHS settings.",TRUE,Peer-reviewed research article on ovarian cancer surveillance.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Uses modelling for cost-effectiveness and measures clinical impact.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['clinical', 'cost']",0.9
J2857,2021,Antiemetics for adults for prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy: a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis,"- Background About 70% to 80% of adults with cancer experience chemotherapyÃ¢â‚¬Âinduced nausea and vomiting (CINV). CINV remains one of the most distressing symptoms associated with cancer therapy and is associated with decreased adherence to chemotherapy. Combining 5Ã¢â‚¬ÂhydroxytryptamineÃ¢â‚¬Â3 (5Ã¢â‚¬ÂHTÃ¢â€šÆ’) receptor antagonists with corticosteroids or additionally with neurokininÃ¢â‚¬Â1 (NKÃ¢â€šÂ) receptor antagonists is effective in preventing CINV among adults receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). Various treatment options are available, but direct headÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âhead comparisons do not allow comparison of all treatments versus another. Objectives Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ In adults with solid cancer or haematological malignancy receiving HEC Ã¢â‚¬Â To compare the effects of antiemetic treatment combinations including NKÃ¢â€šÂ receptor antagonists, 5Ã¢â‚¬ÂHTÃ¢â€šÆ’ receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids on prevention of acute phase (Day 1), delayed phase (Days 2 to 5), and overall (Days 1 to 5) chemotherapyÃ¢â‚¬Âinduced nausea and vomiting in network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis (NMA) Ã¢â‚¬Â To generate a clinically meaningful treatment ranking according to treatment safety and efficacy Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ In adults with solid cancer or haematological malignancy receiving MEC Ã¢â‚¬Â To compare whether antiemetic treatment combinations including NKÃ¢â€šÂ receptor antagonists, 5Ã¢â‚¬ÂHTÃ¢â€šÆ’ receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids are superior for prevention of acute phase (Day 1), delayed phase (Days 2 to 5), and overall (Days 1 to 5) chemotherapyÃ¢â‚¬Âinduced nausea and vomiting to treatment combinations including 5Ã¢â‚¬ÂHTÃ¢â€šÆ’ receptor antagonists and corticosteroids solely, in network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis Ã¢â‚¬Â To generate a clinically meaningful treatment ranking according to treatment safety and efficacy Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, conference proceedings, and study registries from 1988 to February 2021 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Selection criteria We included RCTs including adults with any cancer receiving HEC or MEC (according to the latest definition) and comparing combination therapies of NKÃ¢â€šÂ and 5Ã¢â‚¬ÂHTÃ¢â€šÆ’ inhibitors and corticosteroids for prevention of CINV. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We expressed treatment effects as risk ratios (RRs). Prioritised outcomes were complete control of vomiting during delayed and overall phases, complete control of nausea during the overall phase, quality of life, serious adverse events (SAEs), and onÃ¢â‚¬Âstudy mortality. We assessed GRADE and developed 12 'Summary of findings' tables. We report results of most crucial outcomes in the abstract, that is, complete control of vomiting during the overall phase and SAEs. For a comprehensive illustration of results, we randomly chose aprepitant plus granisetron as exemplary reference treatment for HEC, and granisetron as exemplary reference treatment for MEC. Main results Highly emetogenic chemotherapy ( HEC) We included 73 studies reporting on 25,275 participants and comparing 14 treatment combinations with NKÃ¢â€šÂ and 5Ã¢â‚¬ÂHTÃ¢â€šÆ’ inhibitors. All treatment combinations included corticosteroids. Complete control of vomiting during the overall phase We estimated that 704 of 1000 participants achieve complete control of vomiting in the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when treated with aprepitant + granisetron. Evidence from NMA (39 RCTs, 21,642 participants; 12 treatment combinations with NKÃ¢â€šÂ and 5Ã¢â‚¬ÂHTÃ¢â€šÆ’ inhibitors) suggests that the following drug combinations are more efficacious than aprepitant + granisetron for completely controlling vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days): fosnetupitant + palonosetron (810 of 1000; RR 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.37; moderate certainty), aprepitant + palonosetron (753 of 1000; RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.98 to 1.18; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty), aprepitant + ramosetron (753 of 1000; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.21; low certainty), and fosaprepitant + palonosetron (746 of 1000; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96 to .19; low certainty). Netupitant + palonosetron (704 of 1000; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty) and fosaprepitant + granisetron (697 of 1000; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.06; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty) have little to no impact on complete control of vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when compared to aprepitant + granisetron, respectively. Evidence further suggests that the following drug combinations are less efficacious than aprepitant + granisetron in completely controlling vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days) (ordered by decreasing efficacy): aprepitant + ondansetron (676 of 1000; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.05; low certainty), fosaprepitant + ondansetron (662 of 1000; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04; low certainty), casopitant + ondansetron (634 of 1000; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.03; low certainty), rolapitant + granisetron (627 of 1000; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; moderate certainty), and rolapitant + ondansetron (598 of 1000; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.12; low certainty). We could not include two treatment combinations (ezlopitant + granisetron, aprepitant + tropisetron) in NMA for this outcome because of missing direct comparisons. Serious adverse events We estimated that 35 of 1000 participants experience any SAEs when treated with aprepitant + granisetron. Evidence from NMA (23 RCTs, 16,065 participants; 11 treatment combinations) suggests that fewer participants may experience SAEs when treated with the following drug combinations than with aprepitant + granisetron: fosaprepitant + ondansetron (8 of 1000; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.07; low certainty), casopitant + ondansetron (8 of 1000; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.39; low certainty), netupitant + palonosetron (9 of 1000; RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.58; low certainty), fosaprepitant + granisetron (13 of 1000; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.50; low certainty), and rolapitant + granisetron (20 of 1000; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.70; low certainty). Evidence is very uncertain about the effects of aprepitant + ondansetron (8 of 1000; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.14; very low certainty), aprepitant + ramosetron (11 of 1000; RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.90; very low certainty), fosaprepitant + palonosetron (12 of 1000; RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.95; very low certainty), fosnetupitant + palonosetron (13 of 1000; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.16; very low certainty), and aprepitant + palonosetron (17 of 1000; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.05 to 4.78; very low certainty) on the risk of SAEs when compared to aprepitant + granisetron, respectively. We could not include three treatment combinations (ezlopitant + granisetron, aprepitant + tropisetron, rolapitant + ondansetron) in NMA for this outcome because of missing direct comparisons. Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) We included 38 studies reporting on 12,038 participants and comparing 15 treatment combinations with NKÃ¢â€šÂ and 5Ã¢â‚¬ÂHTÃ¢â€šÆ’ inhibitors, or 5Ã¢â‚¬ÂHTÃ¢â€šÆ’ inhibitors solely. All treatment combinations included corticosteroids. Complete control of vomiting during the overall phase We estimated that 555 of 1000 participants achieve complete control of vomiting in the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when treated with granisetron. Evidence from NMA (22 RCTs, 7800 participants; 11 treatment combinations) suggests that the following drug combinations are more efficacious than granisetron in completely controlling vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days): aprepitant + palonosetron (716 of 1000; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.66; low certainty), netupitant + palonosetron (694 of 1000; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.70; low certainty), and rolapitant + granisetron (660 of 1000; RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.33; high certainty). Palonosetron (588 of 1000; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.32; low certainty) and aprepitant + granisetron (577 of 1000; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.32; low certainty) may or may not increase complete response in the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when compared to granisetron, respectively. Azasetron (560 of 1000; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.34; low certainty) may result in little to no difference in complete response in the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when compared to granisetron. Evidence further suggests that the following drug combinations are less efficacious than granisetron in completely controlling vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days) (ordered by decreasing efficacy): fosaprepitant + ondansetron (500 of 1000; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.22; low certainty), aprepitant + ondansetron (477 of 1000; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.17; low certainty), casopitant + ondansetron (461 of 1000; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12; low certainty), and ondansetron (433 of 1000; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.04; low certainty). We could not include five treatment combinations (fosaprepitant + granisetron, azasetron, dolasetron, ramosetron, tropisetron) in NMA for this outcome because of missing direct comparisons. Serious adverse events We estimated that 153 of 1000 participants experience any SAEs when treated with granisetron. Evidence from pairÃ¢â‚¬Âwise comparison (1 RCT, 1344 participants) suggests that more participants may experience SAEs when treated with rolapitant + granisetron (176 of 1000; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.50; low certainty). NMA was not feasible for this outcome because of missing direct comparisons. Certainty of evidence Our main reason for downgrading was serious or very serious imprecision (e.g. due to wide 95% CIs crossing or including unity, few events leading to wide 95% CIs, or small information size). Additional reasons for downgrading some comparisons or whole networks were serious study limitations due to high risk of bias or moderate inconsistency within networks. Authors' conclusions This field of supportive cancer care is very well researched. However, new drugs or drug combinations are continuously emerging and need to be systematically researched and assessed. For people receiving HEC, synthesised evidence does not suggest one superior treatment for prevention and control of chemotherapyÃ¢â‚¬Âinduced nausea and vomiting. For people receiving MEC, synthesised evidence does not suggest superiority for treatments including both NKÃ¢â€šÂ and 5Ã¢â‚¬ÂHTÃ¢â€šÆ’ inhibitors when compared to treatments including 5Ã¢â‚¬ÂHTÃ¢â€šÆ’ inhibitors only. Rather, the results of our NMA suggest that the choice of 5Ã¢â‚¬ÂHTÃ¢â€šÆ’ inhibitor may have an impact on treatment efficacy in preventing CINV. When interpreting the results of this systematic review, it is important for the reader to understand that NMAs are no substitute for direct headÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âhead comparisons, and that results of our NMA do not necessarily rule out differences that could be clinically relevant for some individuals. Plain language summary Which drug combinations are best for prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy in adults with cancer? The burden of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and what helps to prevent it? In about 70% to 80% of adults with cancer, chemotherapy induces nausea and vomiting (CINV). Depending on the type of chemotherapy, treatment can cause strong or moderate sickness (hereafter referred to as HEC (highly emetogenic chemotherapy) and MEC (moderately emetogenic chemotherapy)). Multiple drug combinations have showed high benefit for CINV among adults receiving HEC or MEC. What was the aim of our review? Using a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis, we aimed to compare the benefits and harms of different drug combinations for prevention of CINV among people receiving HEC or MEC, and to identify treatment ranking. A network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis is a technique used to compare different treatments described in already published trials, even when the original individual trial does not describe such comparisons. What studies did we look at? We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until February 2021. We included studies comparing multiple drug combinations for prevention of CINV among adults with any type of cancer receiving HEC or MEC that is commonly used in clinical practice. In particular, we looked at drugs inhibiting two specific biochemical receptors (neurokinin receptor and serotonin receptor) that trigger nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy. We looked at the preventative effects of these treatments over five days. This is the period during which the maximum intensity of CINV and further peaks of intensity are expected, after the start of chemotherapy. Our key results... ...for people receiving HEC We found 73 studies that reported on the experience of 25,275 participants and compared 14 treatment combinations of our interest. Benefits. Over five days, investigated treatments helped to prevent any vomiting in 60% to 81% of people on average. Those individuals also had no need for rescue medicines, which are used in case nausea and vomiting occur even though prophylactic treatment has been given. The results of our analysis suggest some differences in effectiveness of different treatments, but overall we had little confidence that those differences would be reflected in realÃ¢â‚¬Âworld observations. Harms. We estimated that 1% to 4% of people experience serious side effects. The differences between treatments were small. ...for people receiving MEC We found 38 studies that reported on the experience of 12,038 participants and compared 15 treatment combinations of our interest. Benefits. Over five days, investigated treatments helped prevent any vomiting in 43% to 72% of people on average. Those individuals also had no need for rescue medicines. The results of our analysis suggest some differences in the effectiveness of different treatments, but overall, we had little confidence that those differences would be reflected in realÃ¢â‚¬Âworld observations. Harms. Few studies reported serious side effects. The ones that did suggest that on average 15% to 18% of people experience such events. Differences between treatments were small. However, we think that future research is needed to rule out potential differences between treatments. Our confidence in the findings We assessed how confident we were that there are differences between compared treatments. We had low or very low confidence that one treatment is better or worse than another in preventing CINV. Our confidence in differences between statistical results was mainly limited because measures of variation were wide apart and included both potential advantages and disadvantages, although measures of precision showed no or little effect. We also identified limitations in some of the included studies, which further limited our confidence in the effects. This was mainly the case when study personnel and participants knew which treatments were given and therefore may not adhere to the planned intervention, or may perceive or report effects differently. Our conclusions The results of our analysis suggest that there is no superior drug combination for prevention of CINV for people receiving HEC or MEC. However, results suggest that the choice of drugs targeting the serotonin receptor may impact effectiveness, irrespective of whether given with or without a drug targeting the neurokinin receptor. However, when interpreting these results, it is important for the reader to understand that these kinds of multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomparison analyses are no substitute for headÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âhead comparisons, and that the results do not necessarily rule out differences that could be clinically relevant for some individuals.

J2858,2021,Secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis,"- Background Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years of diagnosis. Several different treatments are available, which include endoscopic sclerotherapy, variceal band ligation, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and surgical portocaval shunts, among others. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of different initial treatments for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis through a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for secondary prevention according to their safety and efficacy. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and a previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices. Selection criteria We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had no previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices, previous history of bleeding only from gastric varices, those who failed previous treatment (refractory bleeding), those who had acute bleeding at the time of treatment, and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation. Data collection and analysis We performed a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR) and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an availableÃ¢â‚¬Âcase analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. Main results We included a total of 48 randomised clinical trials (3526 participants) in the review. FortyÃ¢â‚¬Âsix trials (3442 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies. The followÃ¢â‚¬Âup ranged from two months to 61 months. All the trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 12 interventions were compared in these trials (sclerotherapy, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers, variceal band ligation, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus sclerotherapy, no active intervention, TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt), betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus nitrates, portocaval shunt, sclerotherapy plus variceal band ligation, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus nitrates plus variceal band ligation, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy plus nitrates). Overall, 22.5% of the trial participants who received the reference treatment (chosen because this was the commonest treatment compared in the trials) of sclerotherapy died during the followÃ¢â‚¬Âup period ranging from two months to 61 months. There was considerable uncertainty in the effects of interventions on mortality. Accordingly, none of the interventions showed superiority over another. None of the trials reported healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life. Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in fewer serious adverse events (number of people) than sclerotherapy (OR 0.19; 95% CrI 0.06 to 0.54; 1 trial; 100 participants). Based on low or very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, the adverse events (number of participants) and adverse events (number of events) may be different across many comparisons; however, these differences are due to very small trials at high risk of bias showing large differences in some comparisons leading to many differences despite absence of direct evidence. Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, TIPS may result in large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation (HR 0.12; 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.41; 1 trial; 58 participants). Based on moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, any variceal rebleed was probably lower in sclerotherapy than in no active intervention (HR 0.62; 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.99, direct comparison HR 0.66; 95% CrI 0.11 to 3.13; 3 trials; 296 participants), betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus sclerotherapy than sclerotherapy alone (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.37 to 0.95; direct comparison HR 0.50; 95% CrI 0.07 to 2.96; 4 trials; 231 participants); TIPS than sclerotherapy (HR 0.18; 95% CrI 0.08 to 0.38; direct comparison HR 0.22; 95% CrI 0.01 to 7.51; 2 trials; 109 participants), and in portocaval shunt than sclerotherapy (HR 0.21; 95% CrI 0.05 to 0.77; no direct comparison) groups. Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers alone and TIPS might result in more, other compensation, events than sclerotherapy (rate ratio 2.37; 95% CrI 1.35 to 4.67; 1 trial; 65 participants and rate ratio 2.30; 95% CrI 1.20 to 4.65; 2 trials; 109 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions including those related to betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus variceal band ligation in the remaining comparisons. Authors' conclusions The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions on mortality. Variceal band ligation might result in fewer serious adverse events than sclerotherapy. TIPS might result in a large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation. Sclerotherapy probably results in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than no active intervention. BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus sclerotherapy and TIPS probably result in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than sclerotherapy. BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers alone and TIPS might result in more other compensation events than sclerotherapy. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons. Accordingly, highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality randomised comparative clinical trials are needed. Plain language summary Prevention of rebleeding from enlarged veins in the food pipe (oesophagus) resulting from advanced liver disease What is the aim of this Cochrane Review? Ã¢â‚¬Â¨To find out the best available preventive treatment for repeated bleeding from oesophageal varices (enlarged veins in the food pipe) in people with advanced liver disease (liver cirrhosis, or lateÃ¢â‚¬Âstage scarring of the liver with complications). People with cirrhosis who had previously bled from oesophageal varices are at significant risk of death from another episode of bleeding. Therefore, it is important to provide preventive treatment to prevent rebleeding in such people, but the benefits and harms of different treatments available are currently unclear. The authors of this review collected and analysed all relevant randomised clinical trials with the aim of finding out the best treatment. They found 48 randomised clinical trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups). During analysis of data, authors used standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time. Authors also used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network (or indirect) metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis'). Date of literature search Ã¢â‚¬Â¨December 2019 Key messages Ã¢â‚¬Â¨None of the studies were conducted without flaws, and because of this, there is moderate to very high uncertainty in the findings of this review. Approximately one in five trial participants with cirrhosis who received preventive treatment after control of initial bleeding from oesophageal varices died within five years of treatment with sclerotherapy. What was studied in the review? Ã¢â‚¬Â¨This review looked at adults of any sex, age, and ethnic origin, with advanced liver disease due to various causes and previous bleeding from oesophageal varices. Participants were given different treatments for preventing further bleeding oesophageal varices. The authors excluded studies in people who had bleeding from the stomach, who had no previous bleeding f om the oesophageal varices, those who failed to respond to another treatment before study entry, and those who had liver transplantation previously. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 40 to 63 years. The treatments used in the trials included endoscopic sclerotherapy (injecting into the enlarged veins by looking through a tube inserted through the mouth), variceal band ligation (inserting bands around the dilated veins by seeing through a tube inserted through the mouth), betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers (drugs that slow the heart and decrease the force of heart pumping resulting in decrease pressure in the blood vessels), and TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; an artificial channel that connects the different blood vessels that carry oxygenÃ¢â‚¬Âdepleted blood (venous system)) within the liver to reduce the pressure builtÃ¢â‚¬Âup in the portal venous system, one of the two venous systems draining the liver), portocaval shunt (performing surgery to create the artificial channel described for TIPS) among others. The review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, quality of life, serious and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âserious adverse events, recurrence of bleeding, and development of other complications of advanced liver disease.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ What were the main results of the review? Ã¢â‚¬Â¨The 48 studies included a small number of participants (3526 participants). Study data were sparse. FortyÃ¢â‚¬Âsix studies with 3442 participants provided data for analyses. The followÃ¢â‚¬Âup of the trial participants ranged from two months to five years. The funding source for the research was unclear in 36 studies; commercial organisations funded five studies. There were no concerns regarding the source of funding for the remaining nine studies. The review shows the following.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions on the risk of deathÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â Variceal band ligation might result in fewer serious adverse events than sclerotherapyÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions on serious and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âserious adverse eventsÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â Sclerotherapy probably results in decrease in further bleeding than no treatmentÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus sclerotherapy and TIPS probably result in a decrease in further bleeding than sclerotherapy aloneÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â Portocaval shunt may result in a decrease in further bleeding than sclerotherapyÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisonsÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â None of the trials reported healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of lifeÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â Future wellÃ¢â‚¬Âdesigned trials are needed to find out the best treatment for people with cirrhosis and previous bleeding from oesophageal varices.",TRUE,"Mentions NICE guidance, indicating UK setting",TRUE,"Study involves treatments for variceal bleeding, likely in hospital settings.",TRUE,Peer-reviewed network meta-analysis,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Network meta-analysis with multiple comparators and clinical/safety outcomes.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety']",0.95
J2861,2021,Integrated disease management interventions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"- Background People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) show considerable variation in symptoms, limitations, and wellÃ¢â‚¬Âbeing; this often complicates medical care. A multiÃ¢â‚¬Âdisciplinary and multiÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent programme that addresses different elements of care could improve quality of life (QoL) and exercise tolerance, while reducing the number of exacerbations. Objectives To compare the effectiveness of integrated disease management (IDM) programmes versus usual care for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in terms of healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life (QoL), exercise tolerance, and exacerbationÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL for potentially eligible studies. Searches were current as of September 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IDM programmes for COPD versus usual care were included. Interventions consisted of multiÃ¢â‚¬Âdisciplinary (two or more healthcare providers) and multiÃ¢â‚¬Âtreatment (two or more components) IDM programmes of at least three months' duration. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. If required, we contacted study authors to request additional data. We performed metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalyses using randomÃ¢â‚¬Âeffects modelling. We carried out sensitivity analyses for the quality of included studies and performed subgroup analyses based on setting, study design, dominant intervention components, and region. Main results Along with 26 studies included in the 2013 Cochrane Review, we added 26 studies for this update, resulting in 52 studies involving 21,086 participants for inclusion in the metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis. FollowÃ¢â‚¬Âup periods ranged between 3 and 48 months and were classified as shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (up to 6 months), mediumÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (6 to 15 months), and longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (longer than 15 months) followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. Studies were conducted in 19 different countries. The mean age of included participants was 67 years, and 66% were male. Participants were treated in all types of healthcare settings, including primary (n =15), secondary (n = 22), and tertiary care (n = 5), and combined primary and secondary care (n = 10). Overall, the level of certainty of evidence was moderate to high. We found that IDM probably improves healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated QoL as measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at mediumÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (mean difference (MD) Ã¢â‚¬Â3.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) Ã¢â‚¬Â6.16 to Ã¢â‚¬Â1.63; 18 RCTs, 4321 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). A comparable effect was observed at shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (MD Ã¢â‚¬Â3.78, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â6.29 to Ã¢â‚¬Â1.28; 16 RCTs, 1788 participants). However, the common effect did not exceed the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 points. There was no significant difference between IDM and control for longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup and for generic QoL. IDM probably also leads to a large improvement in maximum and functional exercise capacity, as measured by sixÃ¢â‚¬Âminute walking distance (6MWD), at mediumÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (MD 44.69, 95% CI 24.01 to 65.37; 13 studies, 2071 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The effect exceeded the MCID of 35 metres and was even greater at shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (MD 52.26, 95% CI 32.39 to 72.74; 17 RCTs, 1390 participants) and longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (MD 48.83, 95% CI 16.37 to 80.49; 6 RCTs, 7288 participants) followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. The number of participants with respiratoryÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated admissions was reduced from 324 per 1000 participants in the control group to 235 per 1000 participants in the IDM group (odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.81; 15 RCTs, median followÃ¢â‚¬Âup 12 months, 4207 participants; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Likewise, IDM probably results in a reduction in emergency department (ED) visits (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.50 to 0.93; 9 RCTs, median followÃ¢â‚¬Âup 12 months, 8791 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), a slight reduction in allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause hospital admissions (OR 0.75, 95%CI 0.57 to 0.98; 10 RCT , median followÃ¢â‚¬Âup 12 months, 9030 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), and fewer hospital days per person admitted (MD Ã¢â‚¬Â2.27, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â3.98 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.56; 14 RCTs, median followÃ¢â‚¬Âup 12 months, 3563 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Statistically significant improvement was noted on the Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnoea Scale at shortÃ¢â‚¬Â and mediumÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup but not at longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. No differences between groups were reported for mortality, courses of antibiotics/prednisolone, dyspnoea, and depression and anxiety scores. Subgroup analysis of dominant intervention components and regions of study suggested contextÃ¢â‚¬Â and interventionÃ¢â‚¬Âspecific effects. However, some subgroup analyses were marked by considerable heterogeneity or included few studies. These results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions This review shows that IDM probably results in improvement in diseaseÃ¢â‚¬Âspecific QoL, exercise capacity, hospital admissions, and hospital days per person. Future research should evaluate which combination of IDM components and which intervention duration are most effective for IDM programmes, and should consider contextual determinants of implementation and treatment effect, including processÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated outcomes, longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup, and costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness analyses. Plain language summary Integrated disease management for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease What are the effects of integrated disease management (IDM) programmes on quality of life, ability to exercise, and number of lung attacks compared to usual care in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease and is a major cause of ill health worldwide. People with COPD feel the impact of the disease in their daily life through symptoms such as breathlessness and coughing and acute worsening of symptoms in lung attacks. Different healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurses, and physiotherapists, typically provide different types of care to people with COPD (e.g. prescribe medication, guide selfÃ¢â‚¬Âmanagement, provide education, present exercise training). Previously, people with COPD could visit one or more different healthcare providers, and these providers would work independently. The goal of an integrated disease management (IDM) programme is to include different components of care by which different healthcare providers are coÃ¢â‚¬Âoperating and collaborating to provide more efficient care of better quality. Study characteristics We evaluated 52 studies involving 21,086 people with COPD. These studies were conducted in 19 countries spread all over the world. The average age of participants was 67 years, and 66% of participants were men. Some studies took place in general practices, some in hospitals, and some in both settings. Key results We found that people who participate in an IDM programme probably have better quality of life and their ability to exercise is probably improved compared to those receiving usual care. It is likely that people in an IDM programme have fewer hospital admissions for lung attacks and make fewer visits to an emergency department. When hospitalised, the total number of days people have to spend in hospital is reduced by two days. IDM programmes probably do not help to reduce the number of patients who die. The variety of available programmes makes it difficult to say if one IDM programme is the best. Future studies should look at the most important components and the ideal length of the programme.

J2863,2021,Unicompartmental compared with total knee replacement for patients with multimorbidities: a cohort study using propensity score stratification and inverse probability weighting,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: Although routine NHS data potentially include all patients, confounding limits their use for causal inference. Methods to minimise confounding in observational studies of implantable devices are required to enable the evaluation of patients with severe systemic morbidity who are excluded from many randomised controlled trials.
<b>OBJECTIVES</b>: Stage 1 - replicate the Total or Partial Knee Arthroplasty Trial (TOPKAT), a surgical randomised controlled trial comparing unicompartmental knee replacement with total knee replacement using propensity score and instrumental variable methods. Stage 2 - compare the risk benefits and cost-effectiveness of unicompartmental knee replacement with total knee replacement surgery in patients with severe systemic morbidity who would have been ineligible for TOPKAT using the validated methods from stage 1.
<b>DESIGN</b>: This was a cohort study.
<b>SETTING</b>: Data were obtained from the National Joint Registry database and linked to hospital inpatient (Hospital Episode Statistics) and patient-reported outcome data.
<b>PARTICIPANTS</b>: Stage 1 - people undergoing unicompartmental knee replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery who met the TOPKAT eligibility criteria. Stage 2 - participants with an American Society of Anesthesiologists grade of >= 3.
<b>INTERVENTION</b>: The patients were exposed to either unicompartmental knee replacement surgery or total knee replacement surgery.
<b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</b>: The primary outcome measure was the postoperative Oxford Knee Score. The secondary outcome measures were 90-day postoperative complications (venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction and prosthetic joint infection) and 5-year revision risk and mortality. The main outcome measures for the health economic analysis were health-related quality of life (EuroQol-5 Dimensions) and NHS hospital costs.
<b>RESULTS</b>: In stage 1, propensity score stratification and inverse probability weighting replicated the results of TOPKAT. Propensity score adjustment, propensity score matching and instrumental variables did not. Stage 2 included 2256 unicompartmental knee replacement patients and 57,682 total knee replacement patients who had severe comorbidities, of whom 145 and 23,344 had linked Oxford Knee Scores, respectively. A statistically significant but clinically irrelevant difference favouring unicompartmental knee replacement was observed, with a mean postoperative Oxford Knee Score difference of < 2 points using propensity score stratification; no significant difference was observed using inverse probability weighting. Unicompartmental knee replacement more than halved the risk of venous thromboembolism [relative risk 0.33 (95% confidence interval 0.15 to 0.74) using propensity score stratification; relative risk 0.39 (95% confidence interval 0.16 to 0.96) using inverse probability weighting]. Unicompartmental knee replacement was not associated with myocardial infarction or prosthetic joint infection using either method. In the long term, unicompartmental knee replacement had double the revision risk of total knee replacement [hazard ratio 2.70 (95% confidence interval 2.15 to 3.38) using propensity score stratification; hazard ratio 2.60 (95% confidence interval 1.94 to 3.47) using inverse probability weighting], but half of the mortality [hazard ratio 0.52 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.74) using propensity score stratification; insignificant effect using inverse probability weighting]. Unicompartmental knee replacement had lower costs and higher quality-adjusted life-year gains than total knee replacement for stage 2 participants.
<b>LIMITATIONS</b>: Although some propensity score methods successfully replicated TOPKAT, unresolved confounding may have affected stage 2. Missing Oxford Knee Scores may have led to information bias.
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Propensity score stratification and inverse probability weighting successfully replicated TOPKAT, implying that some (but not all) propensity score methods can be used to evaluate surgical innovations and implantable medical devices using routine NHS data. Unicompartmental knee replacement was safer and more cost-effective than total knee replacement for patients with severe comorbidity and should be considered the first option for suitable patients.
<b>FUTURE WORK</b>: Further research is required to understand the performance of propensity score methods for evaluating surgical innovations and implantable devices.

J2865,2021,"Intermittent catheter techniques, strategies and designs for managing longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm bladder conditions","- Background Intermittent catheterisation (IC) is a commonly recommended procedure for people with incomplete bladder emptying. Frequent complications are urinary tract infection (UTI), urethral trauma and discomfort during catheter use. Despite the many designs of intermittent catheter, including different lengths, materials and coatings, it is unclear which catheter techniques, strategies or designs affect the incidence of UTI and other complications, measures of satisfaction/quality of life and costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007. Objectives To assess the clinical and costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness of different catheterisation techniques, strategies and catheter designs, and their impact, on UTI and other complications, and measures of satisfaction/quality of life among adults and children whose longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm bladder condition is managed by intermittent catheterisation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE InÃ¢â‚¬ÂProcess, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 12 April 2021), the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings, and we attempted to contact other investigators for unpublished data or for clarification. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or randomised crossÃ¢â‚¬Âover trials comparing at least two different catheterisation techniques, strategies or catheter designs. Data collection and analysis As per standard Cochrane methodological procedures, two review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Outcomes included the number of people with symptomatic urinary tract infections, complications such as urethral trauma/bleeding, comfort and ease of use of catheters, participant satisfaction and preference, quality of life measures and economic outcomes. Main results We included 23 trials (1339 randomised participants), including twelve RCTs and eleven crossÃ¢â‚¬Âover trials. Most were small (fewer than 60 participants completed), although three trials had more than 100 participants. Length of followÃ¢â‚¬Âup ranged from one month to 12 months and there was considerable variation in definitions of UTI. Most of the data from crossÃ¢â‚¬Âover trials were not presented in a useable form for this review. Risk of bias was unclear in many domains due to insufficient information in the trial reports and several trials were judged to have a high risk of performance bias due to lack of blinding and a high risk of attrition bias. The certainty of evidence was downgraded for risk of bias, and imprecision due to low numbers of participants. Aseptic versus clean technique We are uncertain if there is any difference between aseptic and clean techniques in the risk of symptomatic UTI because the evidence is lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty and the 95% confidence interval (CI) is consistent with possible benefit and possible harm (RR 1.20 95% CI 0.54 to 2.66; one study; 36 participants). We identified no data relating to the risk of adverse events comparing aseptic and clean techniques or participant satisfaction or preference. SingleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse (sterile) catheter versus multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse (clean) We are uncertain if there is any difference between singleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse and multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse catheters in terms of the risk of symptomatic UTI because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CI is consistent with possible benefit and possible harm (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.55, 1.74; two studies; 97 participants). One study comparing singleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse catheters to multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse catheters reported zero adverse events in either group; no other adverse event data were reported for this comparison. We identified no data for participant satisfaction or preference. HydrophilicÃ¢â‚¬Âcoated catheters versus uncoated catheters We are uncertain if there is any difference between hydrophilic and u coated catheters in terms of the number of people with symptomatic UTI because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CI is consistent with possible benefit and possible harm (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.14; two studies; 98 participants). Uncoated catheters probably slightly reduce the risk of urethral trauma and bleeding compared to hydrophilicÃ¢â‚¬Âcoated catheters (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.87; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The evidence is uncertain if hydrophilicÃ¢â‚¬Âcoated catheters compared with uncoated catheters has any effect on participant satisfaction measured on a 0Ã¢â‚¬Â10 scale (MD 0.7 higher, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.21; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence; one study; 114 participants). Due to the paucity of data, we could not assess the certainty of evidence relating to participant preference (one crossÃ¢â‚¬Âover trial of 29 participants reported greater preference for a hydrophilicÃ¢â‚¬Âcoated catheter (19/29) compared to an uncoated catheter (10/29)). Authors' conclusions Despite a total of 23 trials, the paucity of useable data and uncertainty of the evidence means that it remains unclear whether the incidence of UTI or other complications is affected by use of aseptic or clean technique, single (sterile) or multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse (clean) catheters, coated or uncoated catheters or different catheter lengths. The current research evidence is uncertain and design and reporting issues are significant. More wellÃ¢â‚¬Âdesigned trials are needed. Such trials should include analysis of costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness because there are likely to be substantial differences associated with the use of different catheterisation techniques and strategies, and catheter designs. Plain language summary Intermittent catheter techniques, strategies and catheter designs for managing longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm bladder conditions Review question There are different catheterisation techniques, strategies and catheter designs which may affect symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI; a bladder infection detected through urine testing where the person has symptoms of infection), other complications and user preference. In this review, we focussed on these outcomes in people who used aseptic or clean catheterisation techniques, single or multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse catheters and different designs of catheter (e.g. coated or uncoated, standard or compact length) to determine if one approach or design is better than another. Background Intermittent catheterisation is a common strategy used by people who have bladder emptying problems. A hollow tube (catheter) is passed through the channel to the bladder (urethra) or through a surgically made channel to the skin surface. The catheter is emptied regularly, usually several times every day. Intermittent catheterisation can be done by a healthcare professional or by the person (or carer) themselves. There are various approaches to intermittent catheterisation which could impact on infection, other complications and user experience. There are four main types of intervention considered in this review which might make a difference to users or to costs. Techniques: Aseptic versus clean An Ã¢â‚¬Ëœaseptic techniqueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is used in healthcare settings, with specially packaged sterile equipment (gloves, lubricant and catheter) and a technique that avoids the catheter coming into contact with anything nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsterile (including hands, equipment and surfaces) before it is inserted. People inserting their own catheters use a Ã¢â‚¬ËœcleanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ technique, where the environment is kept as clean as possible and a sterile or clean (multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse) catheter is used without the need for gloves. Strategies: SingleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse versus multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse There are two types of catheter use: singleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse and multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse. ReÃ¢â‚¬Âuse of catheters means that the catheter is cleaned and reÃ¢â‚¬Âused a varying number of times (e.g. for up to 24 hours or for one week/month). Design: Uncoated versus hydrophilicÃ¢â‚¬Âcoated Uncoated catheters are typically clear PVC and packed individually in sterile packaging. They may be supplied preÃ¢â‚¬Âlubricated, or used with a separate lubricant or water to aid insertion HydrophilicÃ¢â‚¬Âcoated catheters have a slippery coating and either are supplied ready to use, or require the addition of water. Design: Shorter versus standard length Catheters come in varying sizes and lengths to suit men, women and children, and people's different needs. How upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate is this review? We searched for evidence that had been published up to 12 April 2021. Study characteristics We found 23 trials (involving a total of 1339 children and adults using intermittent catheterisation for bladder emptying) comparing different catheterisation techniques and catheter designs. Key results Aseptic versus clean techniques We are uncertain if there is any difference between aseptic and clean techniques in the risk of symptomatic UTI. We identified no data relating to the risk of adverse events. SingleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse (sterile) catheter versus multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse (clean) We are uncertain if there is any difference between singleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse and multipleÃ¢â‚¬Âuse catheters in the risk of symptomatic UTI because the certainty of evidence is low. One study comparing these interventions reported zero adverse events in either group and no other adverse event data were reported. HydrophilicÃ¢â‚¬Âcoated catheters versus uncoated catheters We are uncertain if there is any difference between hydrophilic and uncoated catheters in the number of people with symptomatic UTI. Uncoated catheters probably slightly reduce the risk of urethral trauma and bleeding compared to hydrophilicÃ¢â‚¬Âcoated catheters. We are uncertain if there is any difference in patient satisfaction or preference. One catheter length versus another catheter length We are uncertain if there is any difference between one catheter length versus another catheter length for all included outcomes. We identified no useable evidence relating to costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness for any of the comparisons. Certainty of the evidence The current research evidence is uncertain and design and reporting issues are significant. There are many factors that could limit the generalisability of findings, for example, the study setting (e.g. hospital or home), sex of participants, variability in adherence to user instructions and whether catheterisation is undertaken by the user or another person. More wellÃ¢â‚¬Âdesigned trials are needed. Such trials should include analysis of costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness because there are likely to be substantial differences associated with the use of different catheter designs, catheterisation techniques and strategies.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Intermittent catheterisation implies clinical settings like hospitals or home care.,TRUE,"Cochrane Review, likely peer-reviewed.",Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative RCTs with clinical and cost outcomes.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['clinical', 'cost', 'safety', 'pro']",0.95
J2869,2021,A cost utility analysis of robotic versus open mitral valve repair in mitral valve regurgitation,"Objectives: For the first time this study carried out a cost-utility analysis comparing open surgical repair versus robotic minimally invasive surgical repair for Mitral Regurgitation. The respective benefits and costs of each treatment option gained from data in published literature have been analysed and subsequent suggestions for the allocation of resources and treatment recommendation will be offered. Method(s): The analysis was performed by including intraoperative and post-operative costs of the interventions and costs of the most prevalent complications associated with each operation. Thus, the Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) calculated will guide the decision of resource allocation by assessing whether the added cost of robotic surgery is justified given the NICE (National institute of Clinical Excellence) threshold of 30,000/QALY. The choice of perspective taken is through the lens of the British National Healthcare System. Result(s): The Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated was 4781.44/QALY. This ICER shows that if robotic surgery was to become gold standard, the NHS would be paying 4781.44/QALY gained per patient. Considering robotic surgery is associated with fewer complications for patients but also has a cost per QALY below the NICE threshold of 30,000/QALY, it seems that this is a fitting alternative to open heart mitral valve repair. After a sensitivity analysis accounting for the initial robotic capital investment the ICER resulted to 22,379.94/QALY, still below NICE's threshold. Conclusion(s): Our results have shown that robotic assisted minimally invasive repair of the mitral valve is a cost-effective option and can be implemented in the British national healthcare setting.",TRUE,"Study applied to UK setting, references NHS and NICE.",TRUE,Study occurs in NHS setting as inferred from context.,TRUE,Appears to be a peer-reviewed article with cost utility analysis.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Head-to-head comparison with cost and QALY outcomes.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['cost', 'qaly', 'clinical']",0.95
J2870,2021,Double versus single intrauterine insemination (IUI) in stimulated cycles for subfertile couples,"- Background In subfertile couples, couples who have tried to conceive for at least one year, intrauterine insemination (IUI) with ovarian hyperstimulation (OH) is one of the treatment modalities that can be offered. When IUI is performed a second IUI in the same cycle might add to the chances of conceiving. In a previous update of this review in 2010 it was shown that double IUI increases pregnancy rates when compared to single IUI. Since 2010, different clinical trials have been published with differing conclusions about whether double IUI increases pregnancy rates compared to single IUI. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of double intrauterine insemination (IUI) compared to single IUI in stimulated cycles for subfertile couples. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL in July 2020 and LILACS, Google scholar and Epistemonikos in February 2021, together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled, parallel trials of double versus single IUIs in stimulated cycles in subfertile couples. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Main results We identified in nine studies involving subfertile women. The evidence was of low quality; the main limitations were unclear risk of bias, inconsistent results for some outcomes and imprecision, due to small trials with imprecise results. We are uncertain whether double IUI improves live birth rate compared to single IUI (odds ratio (OR) 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 1.88; I 2 = 29%; studies = 3, participants = 468; low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following single IUI is 16%, the chance of live birth following double IUI would be between 12% and 27%. Performing a sensitivity analysis restricted to only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with low risk of selection bias showed similar results. We are uncertain whether double IUI reduces miscarriage rate compared to single IUI (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.98 to 3.24; I 2 = 0%; studies = 6, participants = 2363; low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that chance of miscarriage following single IUI is 1.5% and the chance following double IUI would be between 1.5% and 5%. The reported clinical pregnancy rate per woman randomised may increase with double IUI group (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.86; I 2 = 34%; studies = 9, participants = 2716; low quality evidence). This result should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality of the evidence and the moderate inconsistency. The evidence suggests that the chance of a pregnancy following single IUI is 14% and the chance following double IUI would be between 16% and 23%. We are uncertain whether double IUI affects multiple pregnancy rate compared to single IUI (OR 2.04, 95% CI 0.91 to 4.56; I 2 = 8%; studies = 5; participants = 2203; low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that chance of multiple pregnancy following single IUI is 0.7% and the chance following double IUI would be between 0.85% and 3.7%. We are uncertain whether double IUI has an effect on ectopic pregnancy rate compared to single IUI (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.28; I 2 = 0%; studies = 4, participants = 1048; low quality evidence). The evidence suggests that the chance of an ectopic pregnancy following single IUI is 0.8% and the chance following double IUI would be between 0.3% and 3.2%. Authors' conclusions Our main analysis, of which the evidence is low quality, shows that we are uncertain if double IUI improves live birth and reduces miscarriage compared to single IUI. Our sensitivity analysis restricted to studies of low risk of selection bias for both outcomes is consistent with the main analysis. Clinical pregnancy rate may increase in the double IUI group, but this should be interpreted with caution due to he low quality evidence. We are uncertain whether double IUI has an effect on multiple pregnancy rate and ectopic pregnancy rate compared to single IUI. Plain language summary Double versus single intrauterine insemination for subfertile couples Review question : Cochrane authors reviewed the evidence about the effect of double intrauterine insemination (IUI) versus single IUI in subfertile couples (couples who have tried to conceive for at least one year). Background : for couples who have tried to conceive for at least one year a common way to induce pregnancy is placement of the sperm directly into the uterus and therefore close to any eggs. This is combined with fertility medicines to stimulate the release of eggs (IUI with ovarian stimulation). The insemination is less stressful, invasive and expensive compared to in vitro fertilisation (where an egg is combined with sperm outside the body) and similar procedures. It is often used when a male partner is subfertile, or when the reason for not becoming pregnant is unknown. Generally, IUI is carried out once in a menstrual cycle, but it is sometimes attempted twice (double IUI). Different clinical trials reached differing conclusions whether double IUI resulted in more pregnancies than single IUI. Study characteristics : we found nine randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) comparing double IUI with single IUI with 2751 woman. The evidence is current to July 2020. Key results : our main analysis, of which the evidence is rated as low quality, shows that we are uncertain if double IUI improves live birth and reduces miscarriage compared to single IUI. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following single IUI is 16%, then the chance following double IUI would be between 12% and 27%. The evidence suggests that if chance of miscarriage following single IUI is 1.5%, the chance following double IUI would be between 1.5% and 5%. Performing analysis with the highest quality trials showed similar results for both outcomes. Pregnancy rate may increase with double IUI. This result should be interpreted with caution due to low quality of the evidence. The evidence suggests that chance of pregnancy following single IUI is 14% and the chance following double IUI would be between 16% and 23%. However, when we analysed only with the high quality studies, the positive effect of double IUI was lost and we no longer saw the improvement anymore. We are uncertain whether double IUI reduces multipleÃ¢â‚¬Â (two or more fetuses) and ectopic pregnancy rate (where a fertilised egg implants itself outside of the womb, usually in one of the tubes connecting the ovary and womb) compared to single IUI. The evidence suggests that if the chance of multiple pregnancy following single IUI is 0.7%, then the chance following double IUI would be between 0.7% and 3.2%. The evidence suggests that if the chance of ectopic pregnancy following single IUI is 0.8% and the chance following double IUI would be between 0.3% and 3.2%.

J2871,2021,The Impact of Diagnostic Criteria for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus on Adverse Maternal Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the impact of different gestational-diabetes (GDM) diagnostic-criteria on the risk of adverse-maternal-outcomes. The search process encompassed PubMed (Medline), Scopus, and Web of Science databases to retrieve original, population-based studies with the universal GDM screening approach, published in English language and with a focus on adverse-maternal-outcomes up to January 2020. According to GDM diagnostic criteria, the studies were classified into seven groups. A total of 49 population-based studies consisting of 1409018 pregnant women with GDM and 7,667,546 non-GDM counterparts were selected for data analysis and knowledge synthesis. Accordingly, the risk of adverse-maternal-outcomes including primary-cesarean, induction of labor, maternal-hemorrhage, and pregnancy-related-hypertension, overall, regardless of GDM diagnostic-criteria and in all diagnostic-criteria subgroups were significantly higher than non-GDM counterparts. However, in meta-regression, the increased risk was not influenced by the GDM diagnostic-classification and the magnitude of the risks among patients, using the IADPSG criteria-classification as the most strict-criteria, was similar to other criteria. In conclusion, a reduction in the diagnostic-threshold increased the prevalence of GDM, but the risk of adverse-maternal-outcome was not different among those women who were diagnosed through more or less intensive strategies. Our review findings can empower health-care-providers to select the most cost-effective approach for the screening of GDM among pregnant women.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Gestational diabetes management implies healthcare settings.,TRUE,Systematic review and meta-analysis in reputable databases.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative meta-analysis with adverse maternal outcomes.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['clinical', 'impact']",0.9
J2876,2021,An economic evaluation of vagus nerve stimulation as an adjunctive treatment to anti-seizure medications for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy in England,"Introduction: Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are commonly used to prevent recurring epileptic seizures, but around a third of people with epilepsy fail to achieve an adequate response. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is clinically recommended for people with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) who are not suitable for surgery, but the cost-effectiveness of the intervention has not recently been evaluated. The study objective is to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with using VNS as an adjunct to ongoing ASM therapy, compared to the strategy of using only ASMs in the treatment of people with DRE, from an English National Health Service perspective. Method(s): A cohort state transition model was developed in Microsoft Excel to simulate costs and QALYs of the VNS + ASM and ASM only strategies. Patients could transition between five health states, using a 3-month cycle length. Health states were defined by an expected percentage reduction in seizure frequency, derived from randomized control trial data. Costs included the VNS device as well as its installation, setup, and removal; ASM therapy; adverse events associated with VNS (dyspnea, hoarseness, and cough); and health-state costs associated with epilepsy including hospitalizations, emergency department visits, neurologist visits, and primary care visits. A range of sensitivity analyses, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis, were run to assess the impact of parameter and structural uncertainty. Result(s): In the base case, VNS + ASM had an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 17,771 per QALY gained compared to ASMs alone. The cost-effective ICER was driven by relative reductions in expected seizure frequency and the differences in health care resource use associated therewith. Sensitivity analyses found that the amount of resource use per epilepsy-related health state was a key driver of the cost component. Conclusion(s): VNS is expected to be a cost-effective intervention in the treatment of DRE in the English National Health Service. Copyright Ã‚Â© 2021 The Author(s).

J2878,2021,Chronic nonÃ¢â‚¬Âinvasive ventilation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"- Background Chronic nonÃ¢â‚¬Âinvasive ventilation (NIV) is increasingly being used to treat people with COPD who have respiratory failure, but the evidence supporting this treatment has been conflicting. Objectives To assess the effects of chronic nonÃ¢â‚¬Âinvasive ventilation at home via a facial mask in people with COPD, using a pooled analysis of IPD and metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Register of Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED, proceedings of respiratory conferences, clinical trial registries and bibliographies of relevant studies. We conducted the latest search on 21 December 2020. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chronic NIV for at least five hours per night for three consecutive weeks or more (in addition to standard care) versus standard care alone, in people with COPD. Studies investigating people initiated on NIV in a stable phase and studies investigating NIV commenced after a severe COPD exacerbation were eligible, but we reported and analysed them separately. The primary outcomes were arterial blood gases, healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life (HRQL), exercise capacity (stable COPD) and admissionÃ¢â‚¬Âfree survival (postÃ¢â‚¬Âexacerbation COPD). Secondary outcomes for both populations were: lung function, COPD exacerbations and admissions, and allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality. For stable COPD, we also reported respiratory muscle strength, dyspnoea and sleep efficiency. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. After inclusion of a study, we requested the IPD. We analysed continuous and timeÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âevent data using linearÃ¢â‚¬Â and coxÃ¢â‚¬Âregression mixedÃ¢â‚¬Âeffect models with a random effect on study level. We analysed dichotomous IPD using generalised estimating equations. We adjusted all models for age and sex. We assessed changes in outcomes after three and 12 months. We also conducted a metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis on aggregated trial data. Main results We included 14 new RCTs in this review update, in addition to the seven previously included. Seventeen studies investigated chronic NIV in stable COPD and four studies investigated chronic NIV commenced after a severe COPD exacerbation. Three studies compared NIV to sham continuous positive airway pressure (2 to 4 cmH 2 O). Seven studies used a nasal mask, one study used an oronasal mask and eight studies used both interfaces. Five studies did not report the interface. The majority of trials (20/21) were at high risk of performance bias due to an unblinded design. We considered 11 studies to have a low risk of selection bias and 13 to have a low risk of attrition bias. We collected and analysed the IPD from 13 stable COPD studies (n = 778, 68% of the participants included) and from three postÃ¢â‚¬Âexacerbation studies (n = 364, 96% of the participants included). In the stable COPD group, NIV probably results in a minor benefit on the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) after three months (adjusted mean difference (AMD) 0.27 kPa, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.49; 9 studies, 271 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), but there was little to no benefit at 12 months (AMD 0.09 kPa, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.23 to 0.42; 3 studies, 171 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) was reduced in participants allocated to NIV after three months (AMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.61 kPa, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.77 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.45; 11 studies, 475 participants; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and persisted up to 12 months (AMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.42 kPa, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.68 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.16; 4 studies, 232 participants; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Exercise capacity was measured with the 6Ã¢â‚¬Âminute walking distance (minimal clinical important difference: 26 m). There was no clinically relevant effect of NIV on exercise capacity ( 3 months: AMD 15.5 m, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.8 to 31.7; 8 studies, 330 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence; 12 months: AMD 26.4 m, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â7.6 to 60.5; 3 studies, 134 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). HRQL was measured with the Severe Respiratory I sufficiency and the St. Georges's Respiratory Questionnaire and may be improved by NIV, but only after three months ( 3 months: standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.39, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.62; 5 studies, 259 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence; 12 months: SMD 0.15, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.13 to 0.43; 4 studies, 200 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Lastly, the risk for allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality is likely reduced by NIV (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.97; 3 studies, 405 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). In the postÃ¢â‚¬Âexacerbation COPD group, there was little to no benefit on the PaO 2 after three months, but there may be a slight decrease after 12 months ( 3 months: AMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.10 kPa, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.65 to 0.45; 3 studies, 234 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence; 12 months: Ã¢â‚¬Â0.27 kPa, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.86 to 0.32, 3 studies; 170 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The PaCO 2 was reduced by NIV at both three months (AMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.40 kPa, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.70 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.09; 3 studies, 241 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and 12 months (AMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.52 kPa, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.87 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.18; 3 studies, 175 participants; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). NIV may have little to no benefit on HRQL ( 3 months: SMD 0.25, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.01 to 0.51; 2 studies, 219 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence; 12 months: SMD 0.25, 95% Ã¢â‚¬Â0.06 to 0.55; 2 studies, 164 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). AdmissionÃ¢â‚¬Âfree survival seems improved with NIV (AHR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.94; 2 studies, 317 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), but the risk for allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality does not seem to improve (AHR 0.97, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.28; 2 studies, 317 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Regardless of the timing of initiation, chronic NIV improves daytime hypercapnia. In addition, in stable COPD, survival seems to be improved and there might be a short term HRQL benefit. In people with persistent hypercapnia after a COPD exacerbation, chronic NIV might prolong admissionÃ¢â‚¬Âfree survival without a beneficial effect on HRQL. In stable COPD, future RCTs comparing NIV to a control group receiving standard care might no longer be warranted, but research should focus on identifying participant characteristics that would define treatment success. Furthermore, the optimal timing for initiation of NIV after a severe COPD exacerbation is still unknown. Plain language summary NonÃ¢â‚¬Âinvasive ventilation (ventilators) used at night by people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Background: NonÃ¢â‚¬Âinvasive ventilation (NIV) is a method to assist or replace spontaneous breathing (or normal breathing) with the aid of a machine called a ventilator, using a mask fitted over the nose or both the nose and mouth. NIV can be used chronically (longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm) at the person's home if they have levels of carbon dioxide in their blood that are persistently too high. We wanted to discover if using chronic NIV at home during the night alongside standard therapy was better or worse than standard therapy alone in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have raised carbon dioxide levels. In 2002 and 2013, we published our original Cochrane Reviews investigating this. It is important to check if new studies have been done that could be added to the existing studies of the original review and would change the findings. What is individual participant data: In this review we used individual participant data (IPD). This means that we attempted to collect original research data for each person who had participated in the original studies by requesting these individuals' data from the researcher who performed the study. We used IPD as this offers a greater chance to detect changes between groups of participants and enable the investigation of additional hypotheses. We used the IPD to perform our calculations. Review question: What is the effect of chronic NIV in people with COPD on blood gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide), exercise capacity, quality of life, lung function, respiratory muscle f nction, COPD exacerbations and admissions, and survival? Study characteristics: The evidence is current to 21 December 2020. This review update identified 14 new studies in addition to those already in the review, so in total we included 21 studies. Ten of the studies looked at people in a stable phase (stable COPD) and four studies looked at people shortly after a COPD hospital admission (postÃ¢â‚¬Âexacerbation COPD). All studies included men and women. For our analyses, we used data from 778 people with stable COPD and 364 people with postÃ¢â‚¬Âexacerbation COPD. Results: In all people with COPD who had raised levels of carbon dioxide, chronic NIV for three and 12 months improved blood gases. In stable COPD, chronic NIV also might have improved quality of life, and survival seemed to be better compared to people who were treated with standard care only. There was no relevant benefit of NIV on exercise capacity. People using chronic NIV after a COPD admission experienced less benefit; carbon dioxide levels decreased, the time to the next hospital admission might have been longer when treated with NIV but quality of life and survival were not affected by chronic NIV. Certainty of the results: Our confidence in the certainty (according to GRADE criteria) is good when looking at the blood gases. For the other outcomes, the certainty of the evidence is moderate to very low because the participants and the researcher were aware of the treatment the people received, and due to a wide range in the observed effect. This means that further research might change the results.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,NIV treatment for COPD likely occurs in community health settings.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article from Cochrane review.,Peer-reviewed,0.95,TRUE,RCT with standard care comparator and clinical/PRO outcomes.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,"['clinical', 'pro', 'utilization']",0.95
J2879,2021,Value for money in genitourinary oncology,"Background: Innovation in the treatment of genitourinary (GU) malignancies is accelerating, however, many of these new treatments are often not available for patients. We sought to investigate patient access, cost and value of new systemic anti-cancer compounds (SACTs) in GU oncology. We compared the US and Europe with a focus on the United Kingdom (UK) and the Republic of Ireland (IRL). Method(s): Data on licensing and reimbursement decisions was collected on SACTs approved for GU oncology between 01/01/2010 to 09/01/2020. Overall survival (OS) benefit, progression free survival (PFS) benefit and cost of therapy were included in our analysis. Result(s): There were 29 regimens/indications approved by the Federal Drug Agency (FDA) for GU malignancies between 2010 and 2020. The majority of these (21/29, 72%) were also approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Nearly all regimens/indications were approved by the FDA prior to the EMA (27/29, 93%), with a median time to EMA approval of 4 months (SD = 6, range -6 to 17). Only a minority of these regimens/indications are reimbursed by the public health systems in the UK (12/29, 41%) and IRL (6/29, 21%). Following EMA approval, public reimbursement of these regimens in the UK and IRL is often delayed with a median time of 8 months (+/- 6.3, range 4 - 21) and 11.5 months (+/- 12.5, range 0 - 33) respectively. Approximately half (15/29, 52%) of all reimbursed regimens/indications have demonstrated an overall survival benefit for patients. Androgen signalling inhibitors (ASIs) are more likely to have a proven OS benefit and had a lower mean cost than non- ASI regimens (See Table). A significant minority of regimens/indications (6/29, 21%) have demonstrated neither an OS or PFS benefit. The median price per month (USA list price) was $15,086 +/- $7,019. Regimens with a proven OS benefit were not more expensive than those without ($14,229 +/- $6,466 versus $16,004 +/- $7,704). There was no significant correlation between the length of OS benefit and the cost of regimens (Pearson's Correlation Coefficient = -2.72, p = 0.445). Conclusion(s): Patients in the UK and IRL experience clinically significant delays in accessing FDA approved regimens in GU oncology. Only 52% of these regimens have a proven OS benefit. In our study, ASI regimens are cheaper and more effective than non-ASI regimens. There is no association between overall survival benefit and list prices in the USA.

J2881,2021,Using electronic patient records to assess the effect of a complex antenatal intervention in a cluster randomised controlled trial-data management experience from the DESiGN Trial team,"Background: The use of electronic patient records for assessing outcomes in clinical trials is a methodological strategy intended to drive faster and more cost-efficient acquisition of results. The aim of this manuscript was to outline the data collection and management considerations of a maternity and perinatal clinical trial using data from electronic patient records, exemplifying the DESiGN Trial as a case study. Method(s): The DESiGN Trial is a cluster randomised control trial assessing the effect of a complex intervention versus standard care for identifying small for gestational age foetuses. Data on maternal/perinatal characteristics and outcomes including infants admitted to neonatal care, parameters from foetal ultrasound and details of hospital activity for health-economic evaluation were collected at two time points from four types of electronic patient records held in 22 different electronic record systems at the 13 research clusters. Data were pseudonymised on site using a bespoke Microsoft Excel macro and securely transferred to the central data store. Data quality checks were undertaken. Rules for data harmonisation of the raw data were developed and a data dictionary produced, along with rules and assumptions for data linkage of the datasets. The dictionary included descriptions of the rationale and assumptions for data harmonisation and quality checks. Result(s): Data were collected on 182,052 babies from 178,350 pregnancies in 165,397 unique women. Data availability and completeness varied across research sites; each of eight variables which were key to calculation of the primary outcome were completely missing in median 3 (range 1-4) clusters at the time of the first data download. This improved by the second data download following clarification of instructions to the research sites (each of the eight key variables were completely missing in median 1 (range 0-1) cluster at the second time point). Common data management challenges were harmonising a single variable from multiple sources and categorising free-text data, solutions were developed for this trial. Conclusion(s): Conduct of clinical trials which use electronic patient records for the assessment of outcomes can be time and cost-effective but still requires appropriate time and resources to maximise data quality. A difficulty for pregnancy and perinatal research in the UK is the wide variety of different systems used to collect patient data across maternity units. In this manuscript, we describe how we managed this and provide a detailed data dictionary covering the harmonisation of variable names and values that will be helpful for other researchers working with these data.

J2883,2021,Local versus general anaesthesia for carotid endarterectomy,"- Background Carotid endarterectomy may significantly reduce the risk of stroke in people with recently symptomatic, severe carotid artery stenosis. However, there are significant perioperative risks that may be minimised by performing the operation under local rather than general anaesthetics. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 1996, and previously updated in 2004, 2008, and 2013. Objectives To determine whether carotid endarterectomy under local anaesthetic: 1) reduces the risk of perioperative stroke and death compared with general anaesthetic; 2) reduces the complication rate (other than stroke) following carotid endarterectomy; and 3) is acceptable to individuals and surgeons. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers (to February 2021). We also reviewed reference lists of articles identified. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of local anaesthetics to general anaesthetics for people having carotid endarterectomy were eligible. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and evaluated quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) tool. We calculated a pooled Peto odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the following outcomes that occurred within 30 days of surgery: stroke, death, ipsilateral stroke, stroke or death, myocardial infarction, local haemorrhage, and arteries shunted. Main results We included 16 RCTs involving 4839 participants, of which 3526 were obtained from the single largest trial (GALA). The main findings from our metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis showed that, within 30 days of operation, neither incidence of stroke nor death were significantly different between local and general anaesthesia. Of these, the incidence of stroke in the local and general anaesthesia groups was 3.2% and 3.5%, respectively (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.26; P = 0.58; 13 studies, 4663 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). The rate of ipsilateral stroke under both types of anaesthesia was 3.1% (Peto OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.48; P = 0.89; 2 studies, 3733 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). The incidence of stroke or death in the local anaesthesia group was 3.5%, while stroke or death incidence was 4.1% in the general anaesthesia group (Peto OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.16; P = 0.31; 11 studies, 4391 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). A lower rate of death was observed in the local anaesthetic group but evidence was of low quality (Peto OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.06; P = 0.08; 12 studies, 4421 participants). Authors' conclusions The incidence of stroke and death were not convincingly different between local and general anaesthesia for people undergoing carotid endarterectomy. The current evidence supports the choice of either approach. Further highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality studies are still needed as the evidence is of limited reliability. Plain language summary Is local or general anaesthesia better during surgery to widen the main blood vessel to the brain when it becomes narrowed (carotid endarterectomy)? Key messages Ã¢â‚¬Â Current evidence does not show any clear difference between local anaesthesia (where the patient remains awake) and general anaesthesia for the risk of stroke, death, or other unwanted effects for people having surgery to widen a narrowed carotid artery (carotid endarterectomy). Ã¢â‚¬Â Future studies should recruit more people, analyse and publish information from all of them, and make sure that the researchers assessing the outcomes do not know which type of anaesthetic people had. What is a carotid endarterectomy? A stroke happens when blood stops flowing to any part of your brain. The carotid artery is the main vessel supplying blood to the brain. This artery can become narrowed due to fatty deposits that build up over time. Around 1 in 5 strokes is caused by narrowing of the carotid artery. Blood clots can form at the point of narrowing. If blood clot breaks off into the bloodstream, it can be carried into the brain, where it blocks the blood supply and causes a stroke. A surgical operation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ carotid endarterectomy Ã¢â‚¬â€œ removes the inner lining, fatty deposits and any blood clots in the carotid artery and can lower the risk of stroke. However, even with very careful surgery, approximately 1 in 20 people will suffer a stroke caused by the operation itself. Anaesthetics are medicines that prevent people feeling pain. Surgeons can use either a local anaesthetic, where an area of the body is numbed, or general anaesthetic, where a person is put to sleep. The use of a local anaesthetic rather than a general anaesthetic might lower the risk of a stroke during or after carotid endarterectomy surgery. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if using local anaesthetic for carotid endarterectomy: Ã¢â‚¬Â lowers the risk of stroke and death around the time of the operation;Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â lowers the rate of other unwanted effects; andÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â is more acceptable to individuals and surgeons when compared to general anaesthetic. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared local and general anaesthetics in people who had a carotid endarterectomy. We compared and summarised their results, and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 16 studies involving 4839 people. The biggest study included 3526 people and the smallest study had 20 people. The studies were conducted around the world. More men than women were included in the studies, and their average age was 67 years. Main results Local anaesthetic makes little to no difference in risk of stroke within 30 days of surgery compared to general anaesthetic. Local anaesthetic may not reduce risk of death within 30 days of surgery compared to general anaesthetic. Since neither type of anaesthesia has clear benefits over the other, the choice of which to use can be made on the basis of the clinical situation, and the preferences of the surgeon and patient. Main limitations of the evidence We have either little, or moderate, confidence in these results. The quality of the evidence was reduced because, in most studies, it was possible that researchers collecting information about the outcomes of surgery knew which type of anaesthetic people had been given; this could have influenced their assessments. Also, information from some people who were meant to be included in the studies was left out, which also reduces the quality of the evidence. How up to date is this evidence?

J2886,2021,Run for Your Life: A Systematic Review of Exercise to Reduce Post Treatment Fatigue and Increase Quality of Life in Childhood Cancer Survivors,"Background and Aims: Fatigue and poor quality of life is increasingly recognised in survivors of childhood cancer. Exercise is encouraged to decrease symptoms and increase quality of life. However the literature regarding this approach is slim. We wanted to provide a robust, evidence based platform to guide health care professionals, childhood cancer survivors and their families, when trying to minimise distressing symptomatology and to generate suggestions for future studies Methods: A systematic review of MedLine, EMBASE, PubMed and SPORTdiscus identifying prospective studies, that employed validated tools, measuring the effect of exercise interventions on fatigue and Quality of Life in survivors of childhood cancer, aged under eighteen at diagnosis. Result(s): Five hundred and fifty five papers were identified, two hundred and fourteen of which were screened following duplicate removal. Forty nine full text articles generated twelve studies of sufficient quality. Five randomised controlled trails were identified, the remainder were prospective observational studies. The largest had two hundred and twenty two participants, the smallest sixty eight. There were a total of six hundred and sixteen subjects and two hundred and sixty eight controls. Age range for intervention: 5-24 years. Statistically significant outcomes for fatigue and/or QoL and an overall positive outcome was seen in five studies. Statistically significant results but overall equivocal outcomes were seen in six studies. A negative outcome was seen in one study. No studies reported a cost/benefit analysis. Conclusion(s): Poor study design, a lack of standardised interventions and poor measurement of outcomes hampers research and the ability to give clear messages to childhood cancer survivors. A mixed methodology approach, employing recognised biomarkers, would define what interventions work well for children at different stages of development.

J2887,2021,Intravenous thrombolytic treatment and endovascular thrombectomy for ischaemic wakeÃ¢â‚¬Âup stroke,"- Background About one in five strokes occur during sleep (wakeÃ¢â‚¬Âup stroke). People with wakeÃ¢â‚¬Âup strokes have previously been considered to be ineligible for thrombolytic treatment because the time of stroke onset is unknown. However, recent studies suggest benefit from recanalisation therapies in selected patients. Objectives To assess the effects of intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy versus control in people with acute ischaemic stroke presenting on awakening from sleep. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last search 24 of May 2021). In addition, we searched the following electronic databases in May 2021: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2021, Issue 4 of 12, April 2021) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We searched the Stroke Trials Registry (last search 7 December 2017, as the site is currently inactive). We also screened references lists of relevant trials, contacted trialists, and undertook forward tracking of relevant references. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of intravenous thrombolytic drugs or endovascular thrombectomy treatments in people with acute ischaemic stroke presenting upon awakening. Data collection and analysis Two review authors applied the inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We obtained both published and unpublished data for participants with wakeÃ¢â‚¬Âup strokes. We excluded participants with strokes of unknown onset if the symptoms did not begin upon awakening. Main results We included seven trials with a total of 980 participants, of which five trials with 775 participants investigated intravenous thrombolytic treatment and two trials with 205 participants investigated endovascular thrombectomy in large vessel occlusion in the anterior intracranial circulation. All trials used advanced imaging for selecting patients to treat. For intravenous thrombolytic treatment, good functional outcome (defined as modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2) at 90 days followÃ¢â‚¬Âup was observed in 66% of participants randomised to thrombolytic treatment and 58% of participants randomised to control (risk ratio (RR) 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.26; P = 0.03; 763 participants, 5 RCTs; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Seven per cent of participants randomised to intravenous thrombolytic treatment and 10% of participants randomised to control had died at 90 days followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.07; P = 0.09; 763 participants, 5 RCTs; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage occurred in 3% of participants randomised to intravenous thrombolytic treatment and 1% of participants randomised to control (RR 3.47, 95% CI 0.98 to 12.26; P = 0.05; 754 participants, 4 RCTs; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). For endovascular thrombectomy of large vessel occlusion, good functional outcome at 90 days followÃ¢â‚¬Âup was observed in 46% of participants randomised to endovascular thrombectomy and 9% of participants randomised to control (RR 5.12, 95% CI 2.57 to 10.17; P < 0.001; 205 participants, 2 RCTs; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). TwentyÃ¢â‚¬Âtwo per cent of participants randomised to endovascular thrombectomy and 33% of participants randomised to control had died at 90 days followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.07; P = 0.10; 205 participants, 2 RCTs; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions In selected patients with acute ischaemic wakeÃ¢â‚¬Âup stroke, both intravenous thrombolytic treatment and endovascular thrombectomy of large vessel occlusion improved functional outcome without increasing the risk of death. However, a possible increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage associated with thrombolytic treatment cannot be ruled out. The criteria used for selecting patients to treatment differed between the trials. All studies were relatively small, and six of the seven studies were erminated early. More studies are warranted in order to determine the optimal criteria for selecting patients for treatment. Plain language summary Recanalisation therapies for wakeÃ¢â‚¬Âup stroke Review question Do people who wake up with new acute stroke symptoms benefit from treatments to reopen the blocked blood vessels (recanalisation therapies)? Background Most strokes are caused by a blockage of a blood vessel in the brain by a blood clot (ischaemic stroke). This is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Treatments to reopen blood vessels such as clotÃ¢â‚¬Âdissolving drugs (thrombolysis) or mechanical devices to remove blood clots (thrombectomy) may improve recovery after ischaemic stroke if blood flow is rapidly restored. About one in five strokes occur during sleep (wakeÃ¢â‚¬Âup stroke). People with wakeÃ¢â‚¬Âup stroke have traditionally been considered to be ineligible for recanalisation therapies because the time of stroke onset is unknown. However, recent studies of selected patients suggest benefit from recanalisation therapies. Search date We searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which people are randomly allocated to one of two or more treatment groups) until 24 May 2021. Study characteristics We included seven trials with a total of 980 participants. Five trials with 775 wakeÃ¢â‚¬Âup stroke participants were randomised to intravenous thrombolytic treatment or to control (either placebo (dummy treatment) or standard medical treatment alone). Two trials with 205 wakeÃ¢â‚¬Âup stroke participants with a blood clot in a large brain artery were randomised to either endovascular mechanical thrombectomy plus standard medical treatment or standard medical treatment alone. Key results We found that recanalisation therapies can improve functional outcome and survival in selected patients with wakeÃ¢â‚¬Âup stroke. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that treatment increases the risk of bleeding in the brain. The optimal selection criteria with regard to imaging criteria or time window, or both, for choosing patients to treat is still unclear; these criteria differed between the trials. More trials to investigate this further are therefore warranted.

J2888,2021,Treatment for bleeding oesophageal varices in people with decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis,"- Background Approximately 40% to 95% of people with liver cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed within about one to three years after diagnosis. Several different treatments are available, including, among others, endoscopic sclerotherapy, variceal band ligation, somatostatin analogues, vasopressin analogues, and balloon tamponade. However, there is uncertainty surrounding the individual and relative benefits and harms of these treatments. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of different initial treatments for variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices in adults with decompensated liver cirrhosis, through a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis; and to generate rankings of the different treatments for acute bleeding oesophageal varices, according to their benefits and harms. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until 17 December 2019, to identify randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in people with cirrhosis and acute bleeding from oesophageal varices. Selection criteria We included only RCTs (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and acutely bleeding oesophageal varices. We excluded RCTs in which participants had bleeding only from gastric varices, those who failed previous treatment (refractory bleeding), those in whom initial haemostasis was achieved before inclusion into the trial, and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation. Data collection and analysis We performed a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis with OpenBUGS software, using Bayesian methods, and calculated the differences in treatments using odds ratios (OR) and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an availableÃ¢â‚¬Âcase analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. We performed also the direct comparisons from RCTs using the same codes and the same technical details. Main results We included a total of 52 RCTs (4580 participants) in the review. FortyÃ¢â‚¬Âeight trials (4042 participants) were included in one or more comparisons in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies and those with and without a previous history of bleeding. We included outcomes assessed up to six weeks. All trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 19 interventions were compared in the trials (sclerotherapy, somatostatin analogues, vasopressin analogues, sclerotherapy plus somatostatin analogues, variceal band ligation, balloon tamponade, somatostatin analogues plus variceal band ligation, nitrates plus vasopressin analogues, no active intervention, sclerotherapy plus variceal band ligation, balloon tamponade plus sclerotherapy, balloon tamponade plus somatostatin analogues, balloon tamponade plus vasopressin analogues, variceal band ligation plus vasopressin analogues, balloon tamponade plus nitrates plus vasopressin analogues, balloon tamponade plus variceal band ligation, portocaval shunt, sclerotherapy plus transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and sclerotherapy plus vasopressin analogues). We have reported the effect estimates for the primary and secondary outcomes when there was evidence of differences between the interventions against the reference treatment of sclerotherapy, but reported the other results of the primary and secondary outcomes versus the reference treatment of sclerotherapy without the effect estimates when there was no evidence of differences in order to provide a concise summary of the results. Overall, 15.8% of the trial participants who received the reference treatment of sclerotherapy (chosen because this was the commonest treatment compared in the trials) died during the followÃ¢â‚¬Âup periods, which ranged from three days to six weeks. Based on moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, somatostatin analogues alone had higher mortality than sclerotherapy (OR 1.57, 95% CrI 1.04 to 2. 1; network estimate; direct comparison: 4 trials; 353 participants) and vasopressin analogues alone had higher mortality than sclerotherapy (OR 1.70, 95% CrI 1.13 to 2.62; network estimate; direct comparison: 2 trials; 438 participants). None of the trials reported healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life. Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, a higher proportion of people receiving balloon tamponade plus sclerotherapy had more serious adverse events than those receiving only sclerotherapy (OR 4.23, 95% CrI 1.22 to 17.80; direct estimate; 1 RCT; 60 participants). Based on moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, people receiving vasopressin analogues alone and those receiving variceal band ligation had fewer adverse events than those receiving only sclerotherapy (rate ratio 0.59, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.96; network estimate; direct comparison: 1 RCT; 219 participants; and rate ratio 0.40, 95% CrI 0.21 to 0.74; network estimate; direct comparison: 1 RCT; 77 participants; respectively). Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, the proportion of people who developed symptomatic rebleed was smaller in people who received sclerotherapy plus somatostatin analogues than those receiving only sclerotherapy (OR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.94; direct estimate; 1 RCT; 105 participants). The evidence suggests considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons where sclerotherapy was the control intervention. Authors' conclusions Based on moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, somatostatin analogues alone and vasopressin analogues alone (with supportive therapy) probably result in increased mortality, compared to endoscopic sclerotherapy. Based on moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, vasopressin analogues alone and band ligation alone probably result in fewer adverse events compared to endoscopic sclerotherapy. Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, balloon tamponade plus sclerotherapy may result in large increases in serious adverse events compared to sclerotherapy. Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, sclerotherapy plus somatostatin analogues may result in large decreases in symptomatic rebleed compared to sclerotherapy. In the remaining comparisons, the evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effects of the interventions, compared to sclerotherapy. Plain language summary Treatment for bleeding from enlarged veins in the oesophagus (food pipe) in people with advanced scarring of the liver What is the aim of this Cochrane Review? Ã¢â‚¬Â¨To find out the best available treatment for bleeding from oesophageal varices (enlarged veins in the oesophagus) in people with advanced scarring of the liver (liver cirrhosis, or lateÃ¢â‚¬Âstage scarring of the liver with complications). Bleeding from oesophageal varices in people with cirrhosis is a lifeÃ¢â‚¬Âthreatening event. Therefore, it is important to treat people when this happens, but the benefits and harms of different treatments available are currently unclear. The review authors collected and analysed all relevant randomised clinical trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two or more treatment groups) with the aim of finding out what the best treatment is. They found 52 randomised clinical trials. During analysis of data, the review authors used standard Cochrane methods, which allow the comparison of only two treatments at a time. The authors also used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network (or indirect) metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis'). Date of literature search Ã¢â‚¬Â¨17 December 2019 What was studied in the review? Ã¢â‚¬Â¨This review looked at adults of any sex, age, and ethnic origin, with advanced liver disease due to various causes and bleeding oesophageal varices. Participants were given different treatments for bleeding oesophageal varices. The authors excluded studies in people who had bleeding from the stomach, failed treatment by another method before study entry, those in whom bleeding was controlled by another method before taking part in the study, and those who previously had liver transplantation. The aver ge age of participants, when reported, ranged from 39 to 62 years. The treatments used in the trials included endoscopic sclerotherapy (injecting a scarÃ¢â‚¬Âforming liquid into the enlarged veins (the scarring blocks the veins thereby shrinking the veins) by looking through a tube inserted through the mouth), variceal band ligation (inserting bands around the dilated veins by seeing through a tube inserted through the mouth), somatostatin analogues (drugs that resemble gut hormones and narrow blood vessels), vasopressin analogues (drugs that resemble brain hormones and narrow blood vessels), and balloon tamponade (inserting a tube through the nose or mouth and inflating a balloon around the tube with the hope of pressing on the bleeding veins). The review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death (percentage of participants who died within six weeks of receiving treatment), quality of life, serious adverse events and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âserious adverse events (i.e. serious and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âserious complications), recurrence of bleeding, and development of other complications of advanced liver disease. What were the main results of the review? Ã¢â‚¬Â¨The 52 trials included a small number of participants (4580 participants). FortyÃ¢â‚¬Âeight trials with 4042 participants provided data for analyses. The followÃ¢â‚¬Âup of the trial participants ranged from less than one week to six weeks. The funding source for the research was unclear in 31 studies; commercial organisations funded 11 studies. There were no concerns regarding the source of funding for the remaining 10 studies. The review shows the following. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ None of the studies were conducted without flaws, and because of this, there is moderate to very high uncertainty in the findings.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â Approximately one in six people with cirrhosis and bleeding oesophageal varices who received the standard treatment of sclerotherapy died within six weeks.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â Somatostatin analogues alone and vasopressin analogues alone probably result in increased mortality, compared to sclerotherapy.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â Vasopressin analogues alone and band ligation alone probably result in fewer adverse events (complications), compared to sclerotherapy.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â Balloon tamponade plus sclerotherapy may result in large increase in serious adverse events compared to sclerotherapy.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â Sclerotherapy plus somatostatin analogues may result in large decrease in symptomatic rebleed compared to sclerotherapy.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â None of the trials reported healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â Future wellÃ¢â‚¬Âdesigned randomised clinical trials are needed to find out the best treatment for people with cirrhosis and bleeding oesophageal varices.",TRUE,"Mentions NICE guidance, suggesting UK setting.",TRUE,"Study involves treatment of bleeding varices, likely in hospital settings.",TRUE,Peer-reviewed article with network meta-analysis.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Network meta-analysis with clinical outcomes and multiple comparators.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety', 'pro']",0.95
J2889,2021,Tranexamic acid to reduce head injury death in people with traumatic brain injury: The CRASH-3 international RCT,"Background: Tranexamic acid safely reduces mortality in traumatic extracranial bleeding. Intracranial bleeding is common after traumatic brain injury and can cause brain herniation and death. We assessed the effects of tranexamic acid in traumatic brain injury patients. Objective(s): To assess the effects of tranexamic acid on death, disability and vascular occlusive events in traumatic brain injury patients. We also assessed cost-effectiveness. Design(s): Randomised trial and economic evaluation. Patients were assigned by selecting a numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Patients, caregivers and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. All analyses were by intention to treat.We assessed the cost-effectiveness of tranexamic acid versus no treatment from a UK NHS perspective using the trial results and a Markov model. Setting(s): 175 hospitals in 29 countries. Participant(s): Adults with traumatic brain injury within 3 hours of injury with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of <= 12 or any intracranial bleeding on computerised tomography scan, and no major extracranial bleeding, were eligible. Intervention(s): Tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 minutes then infusion of 1 g over 8 hours) or matching placebo. Main Outcome Measure(s): Head injury death in hospital within 28 days of injury in patients treated within 3 hours of injury. Secondary outcomes were early head injury deaths, all-cause and cause-specific mortality, disability, vascular occlusive events, seizures, complications and adverse events. Result(s): Among patients treated within 3 hours of injury (n = 9127), the risk of head injury death was 18.5% in the tranexamic acid group versus 19.8% in the placebo group (855/4613 vs. 892/4514; risk ratio 0.94, 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.02). In a prespecified analysis excluding patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 or bilateral unreactive pupils at baseline, the results were 12.5% in the tranexamic acid group versus 14.0% in the placebo group (485/3880 vs. 525/3757; risk ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 1.00). There was a reduction in the risk of head injury death with tranexamic acid in those with mild to moderate head injury (166/2846 vs. 207/2769; risk ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.95), but in those with severe head injury (689/1739 vs. 685/1710; risk ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.07) there was no apparent reduction (p-value for heterogeneity = 0.030). Early treatment was more effective in mild and moderate head injury (p = 0.005), but there was no obvious impact of time to treatment in cases of severe head injury (p = 0.73).The risk of disability, vascular occlusive events and seizures was similar in both groups.Tranexamic acid is highly cost-effective for mild and moderate traumatic brain injury (base case of 4288 per quality-adjusted life-year gained). Conclusion(s): Early tranexamic acid treatment reduces head injury deaths. Treatment is cost-effective for patients with mild or moderate traumatic brain injury, or those with both pupils reactive. Future work: Further trials should examine early tranexamic acid treatment in mild head injury. Research on alternative routes of administration is needed. Limitation(s): Time to treatment may have been underestimated.

J2890,2021,A high-dose 24-hour tranexamic acid infusion for the treatment of significant gastrointestinal bleeding: HALT-IT RCT,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: Tranexamic acid reduces blood loss in surgery and the risk of death in trauma patients. Meta-analyses of small trials suggest that tranexamic acid decreases the number of deaths from gastrointestinal bleeding, but these meta-analyses are prone to selection bias.
<b>OBJECTIVE</b>: The trial provides reliable evidence of the effect of tranexamic acid on mortality, rebleeding and complications in significant acute gastrointestinal bleeding.
<b>DESIGN</b>: A multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial and economic analysis. Patients were assigned by selecting one treatment pack from a box of eight, which were identical apart from the pack number. Patients, caregivers and outcome assessors were masked to allocation. The main analyses were by intention to treat.
<b>SETTING</b>: The setting was 164 hospitals in 15 countries, co-ordinated from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
<b>PARTICIPANTS</b>: Adults with significant upper or lower gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 12,009) were eligible if the responsible clinician was substantially uncertain about whether or not to use tranexamic acid. The clinical diagnosis of significant bleeding implied a risk of bleeding to death, including hypotension, tachycardia or signs of shock, or urgent transfusion, endoscopy or surgery.
<b>INTERVENTION</b>: Tranexamic acid (a 1-g loading dose over 10 minutes, then a 3-g maintenance dose over 24 hours) or matching placebo.
<b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</b>: The primary outcome was death due to bleeding within 5 days of randomisation. Secondary outcomes were all-cause and cause-specific mortality; rebleeding; need for endoscopy, surgery or radiological intervention; blood product transfusion; complications; disability; and days spent in intensive care or a high-dependency unit.
<b>RESULTS</b>: A total of 12,009 patients were allocated to receive tranexamic acid (n = 5994, 49.9%) or the matching placebo (n = 6015, 50.1%), of whom 11,952 (99.5%) received the first dose. Death due to bleeding within 5 days of randomisation occurred in 222 (3.7%) patients in the tranexamic acid group and in 226 (3.8%) patients in the placebo group (risk ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.18). Thromboembolic events occurred in 86 (1.4%) patients in the tranexamic acid group and 72 (1.2%) patients in the placebo group (risk ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.88 to 1.64). The risk of arterial thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction or stroke) was similar in both groups (0.7% in the tranexamic acid group vs. 0.8% in the placebo group; risk ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 1.39), but the risk of venous thromboembolic events (deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) was higher in tranexamic acid-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (0.8% vs. 0.4%; risk ratio 1.85, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 2.98). Seizures occurred in 38 patients who received tranexamic acid and in 22 patients who received placebo (0.6% vs. 0.4%, respectively; risk ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 2.93). In the base-case economic analysis, tranexamic acid was not cost-effective and resulted in slightly poorer health outcomes than no tranexamic acid.
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Tranexamic acid did not reduce death from gastrointestinal bleeding and, although inexpensive, it is not cost-effective in adults with acute gastrointestinal bleeding.
<b>FUTURE WORK</b>: These results caution against a uniform approach to the management of patients with major haemorrhage and highlight the need for randomised trials targeted at specific pathophysiological processes.
<b>LIMITATIONS</b>: Although this is one of the largest randomised trials in gastrointestinal bleeding, we cannot rule out a modest increase or decrease in death due to bleeding with tranexamic acid.

J2892,2021,Video games for people with schizophrenia,"- Background Commercial video games are a vastly popular form of recreational activity. Whilst concerns persist regarding possible negative effects of video games, they have been suggested to provide cognitive benefits to users. They are also frequently employed as control interventions in comparisons of more complex cognitive or psychological interventions. If independently effective, video games Ã¢â‚¬Â being both engaging and relatively inexpensive Ã¢â‚¬Â could provide a much more costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffective addÃ¢â‚¬Âon intervention to standard treatment when compared to costly, cognitive interventions. Objectives To review the effects of video games (alone or as an additional intervention) compared to standard care alone or other interventions including, but not limited to, cognitive remediation or cognitive behavioural therapy for people with schizophrenia or schizophreniaÃ¢â‚¬Âlike illnesses. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's StudyÃ¢â‚¬ÂBased Register of Trials (March 2017, August 2018, August 2019). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials focusing on video games for people with schizophrenia or schizophreniaÃ¢â‚¬Âlike illnesses. Data collection and analysis Review authors extracted data independently. For binary outcomes we calculated risk ratio (RR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) on an intentionÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âtreat basis. For continuous data we calculated the mean difference (MD) between groups and its CI. We employed a fixedÃ¢â‚¬Âeffect model for analyses. We assessed risk of bias for the included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE. Main results This review includes seven trials conducted between 2009 and 2018 (total = 468 participants, range 32 to 121). Study duration varied from six weeks to twelve weeks. All interventions in the included trials were given in addition to standard care, including prescribed medication. In trials video games tend to be the control for testing efficacy of complex, cognitive therapies; only two small trials evaluated commercial video games as the intervention. We categorised video game interventions into 'nonÃ¢â‚¬Âexergame' (played statically) and 'exergame' (the players use bodily movements to control the game). Our main outcomes of interest were clinically important changes in: general functioning, cognitive functioning, social functioning, mental state, quality of life, and physical fitness as well as clinically important adverse effects.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨We found no clear difference between nonÃ¢â‚¬Âexergames and cognitive remediation in general functioning scores (Strauss Carpenter Outcome Scale) (MD 0.42, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™0.62 to 1.46; participants = 86; studies = 1, very lowÃ¢â‚¬Â quality evidence ) or social functioning scores (Specific Levels of Functioning Scale) (MD Ã¢Ë†â€™3.13, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â40.17 to 33.91; participants = 53; studies = 1, very lowÃ¢â‚¬Â quality evidence ). There was a clear difference favouring cognitive remediation for cognitive functioning (improved on at least one domain of MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery Test) (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.99; participants = 42; studies = 1, lowÃ¢â‚¬Â quality evidence ). For mental state, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) overall scores showed no clear difference between treatment groups (MD 0.20, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™3.89 to 4.28; participants = 269; studies = 4, lowÃ¢â‚¬Â quality evidence ). Quality of life ratings (Quality of Life Scale) similarly showed no clear intergroup difference (MD 0.01, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™0.40 to 0.42; participants = 87; studies = 1, very lowÃ¢â‚¬Â quality evidence) . Adverse effects were not reported; we chose leaving the study early as a proxy measure. The attrition rate by end of treatment was similar between treatment groups (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.06; participants = 395; studies = 5, lowÃ¢â‚¬Â quality evidence ).Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨One small trial compared exergames with standard care, but few outcomes were reported . No clear difference between interventions was seen for cognitive functioning (measured by MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery Test) (MD 2.90, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â1.27 to 7.07; participants = 33; studies = 1, lowÃ¢â‚¬Â quality evidence) , however a benefit in favour of exergames was found for average change in physical fitness (aerobic fitness) (MD 3.82, 95% CI 1.75 to 5.89; participants = 33; studies = 1, lowÃ¢â‚¬Â quality evidence) . Adverse effects were not reported; we chose leaving the study early as a proxy measure. The attrition rate by end of treatment was similar between treatment groups (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.51; participants = 33; studies = 1). Another small trial compared exergames with nonÃ¢â‚¬Âexergames. Only one of our main outcomes was reported Ã¢â‚¬Â physical fitness, which was measured by average time taken to walk 3 metres. No clear intergroup difference was identified at sixÃ¢â‚¬Âweek followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (MD Ã¢Ë†â€™0.50, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™1.17 to 0.17; participants = 28; studies = 1, very lowÃ¢â‚¬Â quality evidence) . No trials reported adverse effects. We chose leaving the study early as a proxy outcome. Authors' conclusions Our results suggest that nonÃ¢â‚¬Âexergames may have a less beneficial effect on cognitive functioning than cognitive remediation, but have comparable effects for all other outcomes. These data are from a small number of trials, and the evidence is graded as of low or very low quality and is very likely to change with more data. It is difficult to currently establish if the more sophisticated cognitive approaches do any more good Ã¢â‚¬Â or harm Ã¢â‚¬Â than 'static' video games for people with schizophrenia. Where players use bodily movements to control the game (exergames), there is very limited evidence suggesting a possible benefit of exergames compared to standard care in terms of cognitive functioning and aerobic fitness. However, this finding must be replicated in trials with a larger sample size and that are conducted over a longer time frame. We cannot draw any firm conclusions regarding the effects of video games until more highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence is available. There are ongoing studies that may provide helpful data in the near future. Plain language summary Video games for schizophrenia Review question Are video games an effective treatment (on their own or as an addÃ¢â‚¬Âon) for improving the wellÃ¢â‚¬Âbeing and functioning of people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder? Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that affects people worldwide. People with schizophrenia often have a distorted view of reality Ã¢â‚¬Â perceiving things that are not present (hallucinations) and believing things that are not true (delusions). People with schizophrenia may struggle to motivate themselves, experience anxiety and depression, and encounter cognitive symptoms, often struggling to stay focused on dayÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âday activities and becoming disorientated. Hallucinations and delusions are usually treated with antipsychotic medications, whereas other symptoms can be difficult to manage with medication alone. Psychological therapies are sometimes used alongside medication to help with some symptoms of schizophrenia, however these therapies can be complex and expensive. Video games are a relatively inexpensive, and, for many, engaging treatment. They have been suggested to help improve the cognitive impairments such as lack of focus or poor memory that people with schizophrenia often experience. If effective, video games could provide a simple and relatively lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcost additional treatment for people with schizophrenia. Searching We searched for randomised controlled trials (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) involving people with schizophrenia receiving either a video game intervention or other type of treatment such as talking (cognitive) therapy or placebo (dummy treatment). We performed the searches in March 2017, August 2018, and August 2019. Results Seven trials met our inclusion criteria and provided useable data. Video game interventions were categorised into those that involved movements of the body ('exergames') and those that did not ('nonÃ¢â‚¬Âexergames'). NonÃ¢â‚¬Âexergame trials compared the video game intervention to a form of brainÃ¢â‚¬Âtraining"" therapy known as cognitive remediation. One trial compared exergames to standard care, and another compared nonÃ¢â‚¬Âexergames with exergames. All interventions in the included trials were given in addition to standard care. The currently available evidence suggests that nonÃ¢â‚¬Âexergames may not be as beneficial for cognitive functioning as cognitive remediation, but there were no other clear differences between nonÃ¢â‚¬Âexergames and cognitive remediation for improving functioning in people with schizophrenia. The more exerciseÃ¢â‚¬Âorientated video games may have some benefit compared to standard care for improving physical fitness. We cannot draw any firm conclusions regarding the effects of video games until higherÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence is available.""",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Standard care implies NHS or community health setting.,TRUE,"Appears to be a peer-reviewed article, not a protocol or commentary.",Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Uses comparison group and measures clinical outcomes.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,"['clinical', 'pro', 'safety']",0.9
J2893,2021,Virtual patient assessment for hand fracture management: A departmental analysis of financial and clinical implications,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic demanded reduced face-to-face (FTF) contact. Our department integrated virtual assessment into the incoming referral pathway to enable continuation of high-quality care. This study aimed to assess any potential efficiency benefit of this change in service whilst ensuring no compromise to clinical outcomes. Method(s): A prospective analysis was undertaken of all hand fractures referred virtually during a seven-week period starting at the initiation of national lockdown. Cost analysis using NHS reference costs, inflated to 2019/20 prices, was performed. Clinical performance was assessed using the British Society for Surgery for the Hand (BSSH) Standards for Open and Closed Hand Fractures. Result(s): Seventy-six hand fractures were referred; FTF attendance was avoided in 35 cases, with an estimated per-patient cost saving of 179.16. Of the 33 patients who attended FTF, 13 achieved same day non-operative treatment; 20 underwent operative intervention with 95% compliance to BSSH standards. No complications occurred. Conclusion(s): Our pilot model demonstrates potentially significant cost savings of 6270 over a relatively short period, as well as clinical noninferiority. This supports sustained integration of virtual patient assessment in the 'new normal'.

J2894,2021,Effect of testing for cancer on cancerÃ¢â‚¬Â or venous thromboembolism (VTE)Ã¢â‚¬Ârelated mortality and morbidity in people with unprovoked VTE,"- Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a collective term for two conditions: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). A proportion of people with VTE have no underlying or immediately predisposing risk factors and the VTE is referred to as unprovoked. Unprovoked VTE can often be the first clinical manifestation of an underlying malignancy. This has raised the question of whether people with an unprovoked VTE should be investigated for an underlying cancer. Treatment for VTE is different in cancer and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âcancer patients and a correct diagnosis would ensure that people received the optimal treatment for VTE to prevent recurrence and further morbidity. Furthermore, an appropriate cancer diagnosis at an earlier stage could avoid the risk of cancer progression and lead to improvements in cancerÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated mortality and morbidity. This is the third update of the review first published in 2015. Objectives To determine whether testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT of the lower limb or PE) is effective in reducing cancerÃ¢â‚¬Â or VTEÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated mortality and morbidity and to determine which tests for cancer are best at identifying treatable cancers early. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 5 May 2021. We also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomised trials in which people with an unprovoked VTE were allocated to receive specific tests for identifying cancer or clinically indicated tests only were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. The main outcomes of interest were allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality, cancerÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated mortality and VTEÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated mortality. Main results No new studies were identified for this 2021 update. In total, four studies with 1644 participants are included. Two studies assessed the effect of extensive tests including computed tomography (CT) scanning versus tests at the physician's discretion, while the other two studies assessed the effect of standard testing plus positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanning versus standard testing alone. For extensive tests including CT versus tests at the physician's discretion, the certainty of the evidence, as assessed according to GRADE, was low due to risk of bias (early termination of the studies). When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT scanning versus standard testing alone, the certainty of evidence was moderate due to a risk of detection bias. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded further as detection bias was present in one study with a low number of events. When comparing extensive tests including CT versus tests at the physician's discretion, pooled analysis on two studies showed that testing for cancer was consistent with either benefit or no benefit on cancerÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.67; 396 participants; 2 studies; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence).

J2899,2021,Primary prevention of variceal bleeding in people with oesophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis: a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis,"- Background Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years. There are several different treatments to prevent bleeding, including: betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and variceal band ligation. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices in adults with liver cirrhosis through a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices according to their safety and efficacy. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding. Selection criteria We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previous bleeding from oesophageal varices and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation or previously received prophylactic treatment for oesophageal varices. Data collection and analysis We performed a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an availableÃ¢â‚¬Âcase analysis, according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. We performed the direct comparisons from randomised clinical trials using the same codes and the same technical details. Main results We included 66 randomised clinical trials (6653 participants) in the review. Sixty trials (6212 participants) provided data for one or more comparisons in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies and those at high risk of bleeding from oesophageal varices. The followÃ¢â‚¬Âup in the trials that reported outcomes ranged from 6 months to 60 months. All but one of the trials were at high risk of bias. The interventions compared included betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers, no active intervention, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus variceal band ligation, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus nitrates, nitrates, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus sclerotherapy, and portocaval shunt. Overall, 21.2% of participants who received nonÃ¢â‚¬Âselective betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers ('betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers') Ã¢Ë†â€™ the reference treatment (chosen because this was the most common treatment compared in the trials) Ã¢Ë†â€™ died during 8Ã¢â‚¬Âmonth to 60Ã¢â‚¬Âmonth followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus nitrates all had lower mortality versus no active intervention (betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers: HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.36 to 0.67; direct comparison HR: 0.59, 95% CrI 0.42 to 0.83; 10 trials, 1200 participants; variceal band ligation: HR 0.51, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.74; direct comparison HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.12 to 2.14; 3 trials, 355 participants; sclerotherapy: HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.51 to 0.85; direct comparison HR 0.61, 95% CrI 0.41 to 0.90; 18 trials, 1666 participants; betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus nitrates: HR 0.41, 95% CrI 0.20 to 0.85; no direct comparison). No trials reported healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life. Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, variceal band ligation had a higher number of serious adverse events (number of events) than betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers (rate ratio 10.49, 95% CrI 2.83 to 60.64; 1 trial, 168 participants). Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus nitrates had a higher number of 'any adverse events (number of participants)' than betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers alone (OR 3.4 , 95% CrI 1.11 to 11.28; 1 trial, 57 participants). Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, adverse events (number of events) were higher in sclerotherapy than in betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers (rate ratio 2.49, 95% CrI 1.53 to 4.22; direct comparison rate ratio 2.47, 95% CrI 1.27 to 5.06; 2 trials, 90 participants), and in betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus variceal band ligation than in betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers (direct comparison rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.08 to 2.76; 1 trial, 140 participants). Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, any variceal bleed was lower in betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus variceal band ligation than in betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers (direct comparison HR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.04 to 0.71; 1 trial, 173 participants). Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, any variceal bleed was higher in nitrates than betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers (direct comparison HR 6.40, 95% CrI 1.58 to 47.42; 1 trial, 52 participants). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons. Authors' conclusions Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus nitrates may decrease mortality compared to no intervention in people with highÃ¢â‚¬Ârisk oesophageal varices in people with cirrhosis and no previous history of bleeding. Based on lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious adverse events than betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers versus variceal band ligation on variceal bleeding. The evidence also indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in most of the remaining comparisons. Plain language summary Treatment to prevent first bleeding from dilated veins in the oesophagus resulting from advanced scarring of the liver What was the aim of this Cochrane Review? We aimed to find the best available treatment for prevention of first bleeding from oesophageal varices (enlarged veins in the food pipe (oesophagus)) in people with advanced liver scarring (liver cirrhosis, or late stage scarring of the liver with complications). People with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices are at significant risk of bleeding and death. Therefore, treatment is important, but the benefits and harms of different treatments available are currently unclear. The review authors collected and analysed 66 randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with the aim of finding what the best treatment is. During analysis of data, we used standard Cochrane methods, which allow the comparison of only two treatments at a time. We also used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments at the same time (referred to as 'network (or indirect) metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis'). Date of literature search December 2019 Key messages We found that only one of the trials was conducted without flaws, and because of this, there is high to very high uncertainty in the findings. Approximately one in five trial participants with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices who never had bleeding previously and received the standard treatment of betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers died within five years of treatment. The funding source for the research was unclear in 50 trials; commercial organisations funded five trials. There were no concerns regarding the source of funding for the remaining 11 trials. What was studied in the review? This review looked at adults of any sex, age, and ethnic origin with advanced liver disease due to various causes and oesophageal varices, but never had bleeding from the oesophageal varices. Participants were given different treatments for prevention of first bleeding from oesophageal varices. The authors excluded studies in people who had previous bleeding from the oesophageal varices and those who had had a liver transplant or already received treatment for oesophageal varices previously. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 40 years to 63 years. The treatments included 'nonÃ¢â‚¬Âselective betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers' or simply 'betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers' (drugs that slow the heart and decrease the force of heart pumping resulting in decrease pressure in the blood vessels; they also increase the pressure in the gut blood vessels decreasing the amount of blood reaching the oesophageal veins), endoscopic sclerotherapy (injecting clotting agents into the enlarged veins by looking through a tube inserted through the mouth), variceal band ligation (inserting elastic bands around the widened veins by using a tube inserted through the mouth), and nitrates (medicines that decrease the pressure in the gut blood vessels by widening them). The review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death (percentage dead at maximal followÃ¢â‚¬Âup), quality of life, serious and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âserious side effects, percentage of people who developed bleeding, and development of other complications of advanced liver disease.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ What were the main results of the review? The 66 studies included a relatively small number of participants (6653 people). Sixty studies with 6212 participants provided data for analyses. The followÃ¢â‚¬Âup of the trial ranged from six months to five years in studies that reported the outcomes that we were interested in. The review found the following:Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Approximately one in five people with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices (without previous bleeding) who receive the betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers died within five years.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬â€œ BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus nitrates all may result in fewer deaths than no treatment.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious side effects than betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sclerotherapy, betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus nitrates, and betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus variceal band ligation may result in more side effects (when serious and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âserious adverse events were put together) than betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬â€œ BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus variceal band ligation may result in fewer people who develop bleeding than betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers alone based on a single small trial.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nitrates alone may result in more people who develop bleeding than betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers alone.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬â€œ None of the trials reported healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life. What are our conclusions? BetaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers plus nitrates may decrease the death rate compared to no treatment in people with highÃ¢â‚¬Ârisk oesophageal varices in people with cirrhosis and no history of bleeding. Variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious side effects than betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of betaÃ¢â‚¬Âblockers versus variceal band ligation on variceal bleeding. The evidence also indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in most of the remaining comparisons.

J2904,2021,Interventions to enable communication for adult patients requiring an artificial airway with or without mechanical ventilator support,"- Background Inability to communicate in a manner that can be understood causes extreme distress for people requiring an artificial airway and has implications for care quality and patient safety. Options for aided communication include nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvocal, speechÃ¢â‚¬Âgenerating, and voiceÃ¢â‚¬Âenabling aids. Objectives To assess effectiveness of communication aids for people requiring an artificial airway (endotracheal or tracheostomy tube), defined as the proportion of people able to: use a nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvocal communication aid to communicate at least one symptom, need, or preference; or use a voiceÃ¢â‚¬Âenabling communication aid to phonate to produce at least one intelligible word. To assess time to communication/phonation; perceptions of communication; communication quality/success; quality of life; psychological distress; length of stay and costs; and adverse events. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Library (Wiley version), MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), three other databases, and grey literature from inception to 30 July 2020. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasiÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCTs, clusterÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCTs, controlled nonÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomised parallel group, and beforeÃ¢â‚¬Âafter studies evaluating communication aids used in adults with an artificial airway. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently performed data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. Main results We included 11 studies (1931 participants) conducted in intensive care units (ICUs). Eight evaluated nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvocal communication aids and three voiceÃ¢â‚¬Âenabling aids. Usual care was the comparator for all. For six studies, this comprised no aid; usual care in the remaining five studies comprised use of various communication aids. Overall, our confidence in results regarding effectiveness of communication interventions was very low due to imprecision, measurement heterogeneity, inconsistency in results, and most studies at high or unclear risk of bias across multiple domains. No nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvocal aid studies reported our primary outcome. We are uncertain of the effects of early use of a voiceÃ¢â‚¬Âenabling aid compared to routine use on ability to phonate at least one intelligible word (risk ratio (RR) 3.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 50.08; 2 studies; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Compared to usual care without aids, we are uncertain about effects of a nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvocal aid (communication board) on patient satisfaction (standardised mean difference (SMD) 2.92, 95% CI 1.52 to 4.33; 4 studies; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). No studies of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvocal aids reported quality of life. LowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence from two studies suggests early use of a voiceÃ¢â‚¬Âenabling aid may have no effect on quality of life (MD 2.27, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬â€œ7.21 to 11.75). Conceptual differences in measures of psychological distress precluded data pooling; however, intervention arm participants reported less distress suggesting there might be benefit, but our certainty in the evidence is very low. LowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence suggest voiceÃ¢â‚¬Âenabling aids have little or no effect on ICU length of stay; we were unable to determine effects of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvocal aids. Three studies reported different adverse events (physical restraint use, bleeding following tracheostomy, and respiratory parameters indicating respiratory decompensation). Adverse event rates were similar between arms in all three studies. However, uncertainty remains as to any harm associated with communication aids. Authors' conclusions Due to a lack of highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality studies, imprecision, inconsistency of results, and measurement heterogeneity, the evidence provides insufficient information to guide practice as to which communication aid is more appropriate and when to use them. Understanding effectiveness of communication aids would benefit from development of a core outcome measurement set. Plain language summary Strategies to help adults with a breathing tube to communicate What is the issue? Patients needing a machine to support breathin cannot speak due to a tube delivering gas to the lungs bypassing their voice box. Patients mouth words, gesture, and use facial expressions. However, these are very difficult to understand. Weakened muscles and difficulty concentrating, which are common in critical illness, makes using aids such as writing equipment or communication boards difficult. Consistent evidence on which communication aids are effective is lacking. Why is this important? Difficulty communicating places people at increased risk of harm, causes distress to patients and family, and causes stress for healthcare staff. What evidence did we find? We searched for studies (to 30 July 2020) exploring aids used to help people with a breathing tube to communicate. We found 11 studies involving 1931 participants admitted to intensive care units. We also looked for studies involving people needing a breathing tube and living at home or in longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm care, but found none. Eight studies used communication boards or apps. Three studies used aids that help a patient to speak with the breathing tube in place. All studies compared the communication aid to routine communication practices. For six studies, routine practice did not include use of any type of communication aid. For the remaining five studies, usual care comprised a range of communication aids routinely used in the participating intensive care units including a communication board, paper notepad, and routine timing of the use of speech aids. We are unsure about whether the early use of aids to help with speaking may increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood or shorten the time to be able to speak. The evidence was of very low quality. Similarly, compared to routine care in which an aid is not used, we are uncertain about the effects of communication boards on patient satisfaction. We are not sure about the effect on psychological distress and quality of life due to uncertainty in the evidence. Communication aids that help people to speak may have little or no effect on intensive care unit length of stay (lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). We are uncertain of possible harms with use of communication aids as only three studies reported this, and all measured different adverse events, and two were very small studies. What does this mean? We are unsure whether using speaking aids in intensive care might increase the number of people who can say words that can be understood. Use of communication boards may increase patient satisfaction, but we are not sure of these findings because of very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence. This means further studies are likely to change our understanding of the effects of communication aids. More studies are needed to understand the effects of communication aids, particularly effects on psychological wellÃ¢â‚¬Âbeing and people's ability to communicate.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Study conducted in intensive care units.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article from Cochrane Library,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Uses usual care comparator and measures impact outcomes.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety', 'time', 'pro']",0.9
J2905,2021,Posterior musculofascial reconstruction in roboticÃ¢â‚¬Âassisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer,"- Background Delayed recovery of urinary continence is a major adverse effect of roboticÃ¢â‚¬Âassisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) in men undergoing prostate cancer treatment. To address this issue, a number of surgical techniques have been designed to reconstruct the posterior aspect of the rhabdosphincter, which is responsible for urinary continence after removal of the prostate; however, it is unclear how well they work. Objectives To assess the effects of posterior musculofascial reconstruction RALP compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer. Search methods We performed a comprehensive search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, three other databases, trials registries, other sources of the grey literature, and conference proceedings, up to 12 March 2021. We applied no restrictions on publication language or status. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which participants were randomized to undergo variations of posterior musculofascial reconstruction RALP versus no posterior reconstruction during RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. Primary outcomes were: urinary continence recovery within one week after catheter removal, at three months after surgery, and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were: urinary continence recovery at six and twelve months after surgery, potency recovery twelve months after surgery, positive surgical margins (PSM), and biochemical recurrenceÃ¢â‚¬Âfree survival (BCRFS). We performed statistical analyses using a randomÃ¢â‚¬Âeffects model. We rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to the GRADE approach. Main results Our search identified 13 records of eight unique RCTs, of which six were published studies and two were abstract proceedings. We included 1085 randomized participants, of whom 963 completed the trials (88.8%). All participants had either cT1c or cT2 or cT3a disease, with a mean prostateÃ¢â‚¬Âspecific antigen level of 8.15 ng/mL. Primary outcomes Posterior reconstruction RALP (PRÃ¢â‚¬ÂRALP) may improve urinary continence one week after catheter removal compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 1.73; I 2 = 42%; studies = 5, participants = 498; low CoE) although the CI also includes the possibility of no effect. Assuming 335 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 84 more men per 1000 (33 fewer to 244 more) reporting urinary continence recovery. Posterior reconstruction may have little to no effect on urinary continence three months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.14; I 2 = 67%; studies = 6, participants = 842; low CoE). Assuming 701 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 14 fewer men per 1000 (112 fewer to 98 more) reporting urinary continence after three months. PRÃ¢â‚¬ÂRALP probably results in little to no difference in serious adverse events compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.92; I 2 = 0%; studies = 6, participants = 835; moderate CoE). Assuming 25 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP experience a serious adverse event at this time point, this corresponds to six fewer men per 1000 (17 fewer to 23 more) reporting serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes PRÃ¢â‚¬ÂRALP may result in little to no difference in recovery of continence 12 months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.07; I 2 = 25%; studies = 3, participants = 602; low CoE). Assuming 918 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are continent at this time point, this corresponds to 18 more men per 1000 (18 fewer to 64 more) reporting urinary continence recovery. We are very uncertain about the effects of PRÃ¢â‚¬ÂRALP on recovery of pote cy 12 months after surgery compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26; I 2 = 3%; studies = 2, participants = 308; very low CoE). Assuming 433 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP are potent at this time point, this corresponds to nine more men per 1000 (78 fewer to 113 more) reporting potency recovery. PRÃ¢â‚¬ÂRALP may result in little to no difference in positive surgical margins compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.33; I 2 = 50%; studies = 3, participants = 517; low CoE). Assuming 130 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP have a positive surgical margin, this corresponds to 31 more men per 1000 (46 fewer to 173 more) reporting positive surgical margins. PRÃ¢â‚¬ÂRALP may result in little to no difference in biochemical recurrence compared to no posterior reconstruction during RALP (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.52; I 2 = 0%; studies = 2, participants = 468; low CoE). Assuming 70 per 1000 men undergoing standard RALP have experienced biochemical recurrence at this time point, this corresponds to 25 more men per 1000 (18 fewer to 107 more) reporting biochemical recurrence. Authors' conclusions This review found evidence that PRÃ¢â‚¬ÂRALP may improve early continence one week after catheter removal but not thereafter. Meanwhile, adverse event rates are probably not impacted and surgical margins rates are likely similar. This review was unable to determine if or how these findings may be impacted by the person's age, nerveÃ¢â‚¬Âsparing status, or clinical stage. Study limitations, imprecision, and inconsistency lowered the certainty of evidence for the outcomes assessed. Plain language summary Should we perform posterior reconstruction RALP or standard RALP for clinically localized prostate cancer? Review question In men with prostate cancer who are having their prostate removed using surgery assisted by a robotic device (called roboticÃ¢â‚¬Âassisted laparoscopic prostatectomy, or RALP), how does connecting the tissue behind the urethra (soÃ¢â‚¬Âcalled posterior reconstruction) compare to surgery where these connections are not made (standard RALP)? Background Urologists often use a robot to remove the prostate in men with prostate cancer. After surgery, most men leak urine for some time. This problem is called incontinence and usually improves six to 12 months after surgery in most men. However, it can be very bothersome during this time. Study characteristics We included eight studies in which chance determined whether men had posterior reconstruction RALP or standard RALP. These studies included 1085 men with an average age ranging from 60 to 67 years. The average prostateÃ¢â‚¬Âspecific antigen (PSA) level in the men was 8.15 ng/mL. Higher levels of PSA may indicate worse prostate cancer. Key results We found that posterior reconstruction RALP may result in better continence one week after the catheter comes out compared to standard RALP (although it is also possible that it is no better), but it may make little to no difference at either three or 12 months after surgery. Posterior reconstruction RALP probably results in little to no difference in serious unwanted effects compared with the standard way of doing the surgery. There may also be little to no difference in positive surgical margins, meaning the risk of there being cancer cells right at the cut edge of the prostate when viewed under the microscope. There may also be no difference between the two techniques in terms of the risk of a PSA level that goes up within 12 months of surgery, which often signals that there is cancer left behind. We are very uncertain how posterior reconstruction RALP effects the ability to achieve an erection, compared to standard RALP.

J2906,2021,A review of emergency models of care for cancer patients,"Introduction Emergency departments (ED) are considered sub-optimal to satisfy the needs of cancer patients. Various international groups have developed strategies to improve the acute attention of cancer patients. This study aims to review the existing evidence on the effectivity of various innovative models of care for cancer emergency attention. Methods Literature review of seven databases during the period 2000-2019, including articles published in English and Spanish. Results A total of 10 articles were included: four descriptive studies, three quasi-experimental studies, two retrospective studies, and a qualitative study. They described new strategies in common ED clinical pathways or the creation of specialized units for the attention of cancer emergencies. The authors report reductions in the number of admissions, length of hospital stay and, furthermore, cost reductions. A previous triage and telephone attention service is considered key to increase the efficiency of the interventions. The authors reflect the importance of multidisciplinary attention, early integration of palliative care, and effective coordination with community services. Conclusions Enhancing the care of cancer patients who require emergency attention is possible through the creation of specific pathways or dedicated units staffed with professionals who are knowledgeable about cancer complications and treatment secondary effects.

Value of information analysis can determine whether further research on this topic is of value. Objective(s): To determine (1) whether current evidence suggests that screening is potentially cost-effective and, if so, (2) in which age/sex groups, (3) identify evidence gaps, and (4) estimate the value of further research to close those gaps. Design, setting, and participants: A decision model was developed evaluating screening in asymptomatic individuals in the UK. A National Health Service perspective was adopted. Intervention(s): A single focused renal ultrasound scan compared with standard of care (no screening). Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Expected lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results and limitations: Given a prevalence of RCC of 0.34% (0.18-0.54%), screening 60-yr-old men resulted in an ICER of 18 092/QALY (22 843/QALY). Given a prevalence of RCC of 0.16% (0.08-0.25%), screening 60-yr-old women resulted in an ICER of 37 327/QALY (47 129/QALY). In the one-way sensitivity analysis, the ICER was <30 000/QALY as long as the prevalence of RCC was >=0.25% for men and >=0.2% for women at age 60 yr. Given the willingness to pay a threshold of 30 000/QALY (37 878/QALY), the population-expected values of perfect information were 194 million (244 million) and 97 million (123 million) for 60-yr-old men and women, respectively. The expected value of perfect parameter information suggests that the prevalence of RCC and stage shift associated with screening are key research priorities. Conclusion(s): Current evidence suggests that one-off screening of 60-yr-old men is potentially cost-effective and that further research into this topic would be of value to society. Patient Summary: Economic modelling suggests that screening 60-yr-old men for kidney cancer using ultrasound may be a good use of resources and that further research on this topic should be performed.

J6200,2025,High-flow nasal cannula therapy versus continuous positive airway pressure for non-invasive respiratory support in paediatric critical care: the FIRST-ABC RCTs,"<b>Background</b>: Despite the increasing use of non-invasive respiratory support in paediatric intensive care units, there are no large randomised controlled trials comparing two commonly used non-invasive respiratory support modes, continuous positive airway pressure and high-flow nasal cannula therapy.
<b>Objective</b>: To evaluate the non-inferiority of high-flow nasal cannula, compared with continuous positive airway pressure, when used as the first-line mode of non-invasive respiratory support in acutely ill children and following extubation, on time to liberation from respiratory support, defined as the start of a 48-hour period during which the child was free of respiratory support (non-invasive and invasive).
<b>Design</b>: A master protocol comprising two pragmatic, multicentre, parallel-group, non-inferiority randomised controlled trials (step-up and step-down) with shared infrastructure, including internal pilot and integrated health economic evaluation.
<b>Setting</b>: Twenty-five National Health Service paediatric critical care units (paediatric intensive care units and/or high-dependency units) across England, Wales and Scotland.
<b>Participants</b>: Critically ill children assessed by the treating clinician to require non-invasive respiratory support for (1) acute illness (step-up randomised controlled trial) or (2) within 72 hours of extubation (step-down randomised controlled trial).
<b>Interventions</b>: High-flow nasal cannula delivered at a flow rate based on patient weight (Intervention) compared to continuous positive airway pressure of 7-8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O pressure (Control).
<b>Main outcome measures</b>: The primary clinical outcome was time to liberation from respiratory support. The primary cost-effectiveness outcome was 180-day incremental net monetary benefit. Secondary outcomes included mortality at paediatric intensive care unit/high-dependency unit discharge, day 60 and day 180; (re)intubation rate at 48 hours; duration of paediatric intensive care unit/high-dependency unit and hospital stay; patient comfort; sedation use; parental stress; and health-related quality of life at 180 days.
<b>Results</b>: In the step-up randomised controlled trial, out of 600 children randomised, 573 were included in the primary analysis (median age 9 months). Median time to liberation was 52.9 hours for high-flow nasal cannula (95% confidence interval 46.0 to 60.9 hours) and 47.9 hours (95% confidence interval 40.5 to 55.7 hours) for continuous positive airway pressure (adjusted hazard ratio 1.03, one-sided 97.5% confidence interval 0.86 to ). The high-flow nasal cannula group had lower use of sedation (27.7% vs. 37%) and mean duration of acute hospital stay (13.8 days vs. 19.5 days). In the step-down randomised controlled trial, of the 600 children randomised, 553 were included in the primary analysis (median age 3 months). Median time to liberation for high-flow nasal cannula was 50.5 hours (95% confidence interval, 43.0 to 67.9) versus 42.9 hours (95% confidence interval 30.5 to 48.2) for continuous positive airway pressure (adjusted hazard ratio 0.83, one-sided 97.5% confidence interval 0.70 to ). Mortality at day 180 was significantly higher for high-flow nasal cannula [5.6% vs. 2.4% for continuous positive airway pressure, adjusted odds ratio, 3.07 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 8.8)].
<b>Limitations</b>: The interventions were unblinded. A heterogeneous cohort of children with a range of diagnoses and severity of illness were included.
<b>Conclusions</b>: Among acutely ill children requiring non-invasive respiratory support, high-flow nasal cannula met the criterion for non-inferiority compared with continuous positive airway pressure for time to liberation from respiratory support whereas in critically ill children requiring non-invasive respiratory support following extubation, the non-inferiority of high-flow nasal cannula could not be demonstrated.
<b>Future work</b>: (1) Identify risk factors for treatment failure. (2) Compare protocolised approaches to post-extubation non-invasive respiratory support, with standard care. (3) Explore alternative approaches for evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect. (4) Explore reasons for increased mortality in high-flow nasal cannula group within step-down randomised controlled trial.

J6205,2025,A Systematic Literature Review of Randomized Trials Comparing In-Person and Digital Interventions for Type 2 Diabetes Prevention,"Background: Digital and in-person lifestyle interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are being increasingly implemented in some countries, particularly in the United States. However, their comparative effectiveness remains unclear, partly due to variability in intervention designs and limited robust evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Understanding their relative impacts is critical for informing evidence-based implementation in diverse healthcare settings. Aim(s): To compare the effectiveness of digital versus in-person interventions for preventing T2DM. Method(s): We conducted a systematic literature review, following Cochrane methodology to identify and synthesize evidence from RCTs. Searches were conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to December 2024, including completed and ongoing trials published in English or Spanish. Studies comparing purely digital and in-person interventions were eligible. Meta-analyses were performed where appropriate, and narrative syntheses were provided for remaining outcomes. The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Result(s): Eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria, including six completed trials with published results and two ongoing trials. The completed trials encompassed a total of 2,450 participants across various healthcare settings. At 12 months, digital interventions were associated with significantly greater weight loss than in-person interventions (mean difference: -1.38 kg [95% CI: -2.34 to -0.43]), with moderate certainty of evidence. At shorter (3 and 6 months) and longer (>12 months) time points, no relevant differences were observed for weight, body mass index, or glycosylated haemoglobin levels between the modalities, with the certainty of evidence rated as low to very low. Evidence about cost-effectiveness was scarce. No trials evaluated key outcomes such as incidence of T2DM or health-related quality. For adverse events, no significant differences were found between modalities (RR: 1.06 [95% CI: 0.45 to 2.50]). Conclusion(s): This systematic review highlights that while digital and in-person interventions can both be effective for T2DM prevention, their relative benefits depend on follow-up duration and contextual factors. The limited certainty of evidence and the absence of trials addressing critical outcomes, such as T2DM incidence, underscore the need for further well-designed RCTs. Future research should prioritize equivalence in intervention intensity, longer follow-up durations, and standardized reporting of outcomes to better inform public health decision-making.

J6206,2025,NonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacological and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical treatments for low back pain in adults: an overview of Cochrane reviews,"- Background Low back pain (LBP) is a significant public health issue due to its high prevalence and associated disability burden. Clinical practice guidelines recommend nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacological/nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical interventions for managing pain and function in people with LBP. Objectives To provide accessible, highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence on the effects of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacological and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical interventions for people with LBP and to highlight areas of remaining uncertainty and gaps in the evidence regarding the effects of these interventions for people with LBP. Methods We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to 15 April 2023, to identify Cochrane reviews of randomised controlled trials testing the effect of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacological/nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical interventions, unrestricted by language. Major outcomes were pain intensity, function and safety. Two authors independently assessed eligibility, extracted data and assessed the quality of the reviews using AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews) and the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The primary comparison was placebo/sham. Main results We included 31 Cochrane reviews of 644 trials that randomised 97,183 adults with LBP. We have high confidence in the findings of 19 reviews, moderate confidence in the findings of two reviews, and low confidence in the findings of 10 reviews. We present results for nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacological/nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical interventions compared to placebo/sham or no treatment/usual care at shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm (Ã¢â€°Â¤ three months) followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. Placebo/sham comparisons Acute/subacute LBP Compared to placebo, there is probably no difference in function (at oneÃ¢â‚¬Âweek followÃ¢â‚¬Âup) for spinal manipulation (standardised mean difference (SMD) Ã¢â‚¬Â0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) Ã¢â‚¬Â0.37 to 0.21; 2 trials, 205 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Data for safety were reported only for heated back wrap. Compared to placebo, heated back wrap may result in skin pinkness (6/128 participants versus 1/130; 2 trials; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Chronic LBP Compared to sham acupuncture, acupuncture probably provides a small improvement in function (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.38, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.69 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.07; 3 trials, 957 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Compared to sham traction, there is probably no difference in pain intensity for traction (0 to 100 scale, mean difference (MD) Ã¢â‚¬Â4, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â17.7 to 9.7; 1 trial, 60 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Data for safety were reported only for acupuncture. There may be no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture for safety outcomes (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.10; I 2 = 0%; 4 trials, 465 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). No treatment/usual care comparisons Acute/subacute LBP Compared to advice to rest, advice to stay active probably provides a small reduction in pain intensity (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.22, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.02 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.41; 2 trials, 401 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Compared to advice to rest, advice to stay active probably provides a small improvement in function (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.29, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.09 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.49; 2 trials, 400 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Data for safety were reported only for massage. There may be no difference between massage and usual care for safety (risk difference 0, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.07 to 0.07; 1 trial, 51 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Chronic LBP Compared to no treatment, acupuncture probably provides a medium reduction in pain intensity (0 to 100 scale, mean difference (MD) Ã¢â‚¬Â10.1, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â16.8 to Ã¢â‚¬Â3.4; 3 trials, 144 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), and a small improvement in function (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.39, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.72 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.06; 3 trials, 144 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Compared to usual care, acupuncture probably provides a small improvement in function (MD 9.4, 95% CI 6.15 to 12.65; 1 trial, 734 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Compared to no treatment/usual care, exercise therapies probably provide a small to medium reduction in pain intens ty (0 to 100 scale, MD Ã¢â‚¬Â15.2, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â18.3 to Ã¢â‚¬Â12.2; 35 trials, 2746 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), and probably provide a small improvement in function (0 to 100 scale, MD Ã¢â‚¬Â6.8, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â8.3 to Ã¢â‚¬Â5.3; 38 trials, 2942 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Compared to usual care, multidisciplinary therapies probably provide a medium reduction in pain intensity (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.55, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.83 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.28; 9 trials, 879 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), and probably provide a small improvement in function (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.41, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.62 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.19; 9 trials, 939 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Compared to no treatment, psychological therapies using operant approaches probably provide a small reduction in pain intensity (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.43, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.75 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.11; 3 trials, 153 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Compared to usual care, psychological therapies (including progressive muscle relaxation and behavioural approaches) probably provide a small reduction in pain intensity (0 to 100 scale, MD Ã¢â‚¬Â5.18, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â9.79 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.57; 2 trials, 330 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), but there is probably no difference in function (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.2, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.41 to 0.02; 2 trials, 330 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). It is uncertain whether there is a difference between nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacological/nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical interventions and no treatment/usual care for safety (very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Spinal manipulation probably makes no difference to function compared to placebo for people with acute/subacute LBP. Acupuncture probably improves function slightly for people with chronic LBP, compared to sham acupuncture. There is probably no difference between traction and sham traction for pain intensity in people with chronic LBP. Compared to advice to rest, advice to stay active probably reduces pain intensity slightly and improves function slightly for people with acute LBP. Acupuncture probably reduces pain intensity, and improves function slightly for people with chronic LBP, compared to no treatment. Acupuncture probably improves function slightly for people with chronic LBP, compared to usual care. Exercise therapies probably reduce pain intensity, and improve function slightly for people with chronic LBP, compared to no treatment/usual care. Multidisciplinary therapies probably reduce pain intensity, and improve function slightly for people with chronic LBP, compared to usual care. Compared to usual care, psychological therapies probably reduce pain intensity slightly, but probably make no difference to function for people with chronic LBP. Plain language summary What are the likely benefits and harms of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âmedicine and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical treatments for nonÃ¢â‚¬Âspecific low back pain? Key messages For acute low back pain (pain lasting less than 6 weeks) Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Advice to stay active probably reduces pain and improves function compared to advice to rest in bed. For subacute low back pain (pain lasting from 6 to 12 weeks) Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Multidisciplinary therapies probably reduce pain compared to usual care.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Spinal manipulation probably does not improve function compared to placebo (a 'sham' or 'dummy' treatment designed to resemble the actual treatment but lacking active ingredients or the intended therapeutic effect). For chronic low back pain (pain lasting longer than 12 weeks) Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Acupuncture probably reduces pain and improves function compared to placebo and no treatment/usual care.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Exercise therapies probably reduce pain and improve function compared to placebo and no treatment/usual care.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Traction probably does not reduce pain compared to sham traction.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Multidisciplinary therapy probably reduces pain and improves function compared to usual care.Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Psychological therapies probably reduce pain but make no difference to function compared to usual care. What is low back pain, and how is it treated? Low back pain is a common health condition that can be associated with disability and poor quality of life. For most cases f low back pain, the cause of pain is unknown and is described as Ã¢â‚¬ËœnonÃ¢â‚¬ÂspecificÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ low back pain. Many types of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âmedicine and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical treatments are available for people with low back pain of different durations: acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), subacute (pain lasting from 6 to 12 weeks) and chronic (pain lasting longer than 12 weeks). There is a need to provide accessible, highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality information on the benefits and safety of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âdrug and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical treatments for healthcare professionals and patients to better manage low back pain. What did we want to find out? We wanted to summarise the evidence from Cochrane reviews on the effectiveness and safety of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âmedicine and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical treatments for adults with nonÃ¢â‚¬Âspecific low back pain. What did we do? Ã¢â‚¬Â¨We found 31 reviews that included 644 studies with 97,183 participants. The studies investigated the effects of 27 different types of treatment for low back pain. What did we find? For people with acute/subacute low back pain, we found that advice to stay active probably reduces pain in the short term (i.e. up to 3 months) compared to advice to rest in bed. We found that multidisciplinary therapies probably reduce pain in the long term (i.e. at 12 months or longer). Spinal manipulation probably does not improve function in the short term. For people with chronic low back pain, we found that acupuncture, exercise, and psychological therapies probably reduce pain in the short and medium term (i.e. from 3 to 12 months). Acupuncture and exercise probably also improve function in the short and medium term. Multidisciplinary therapies probably reduce pain and improve function in the short and medium term. Traction probably does not reduce pain in the short term. We have less confidence in the effects of other nonÃ¢â‚¬Âmedicine and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical interventions for low back pain. NonÃ¢â‚¬Âmedicine and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical interventions may not be associated with serious adverse (i.e. unwanted, harmful) events. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have reduced confidence in the evidence because we judged that 38% of the reviews did not employ the most rigorous methods available. Almost threeÃ¢â‚¬Âquarters of the reviews were published before 2020, meaning that the evidence they contain may be relatively dated. There is a need to update some Cochrane reviews following recommended guidance. Because of the quality of the evidence, we are still uncertain about the benefits or risks of many nonÃ¢â‚¬Âmedicine and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsurgical treatments commonly used in clinical practice for low back pain. We encourage healthcare professionals, patients, and organisations that fund research on low back pain to use this overview to make informed decisions for low back pain treatment. How current is this evidence? This overview is current to April 2023. However, oneÃ¢â‚¬Âthird (10 of 31) of the reviews are more than 15 years old, meaning the evidence they contain is even more dated.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Interventions likely occur in community health settings.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article from Cochrane Database,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative effects on clinical outcomes with placebo and usual care comparators.,TRUE,Placebo,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety', 'pro']",0.95
J6207,2025,Economic evaluation of a hospital-initiated tobacco dependence treatment service,"The treatment of tobacco dependence in patients admitted to hospital is a priority for the National Health Service in England. We conducted an economic analysis of a pilot intervention adapted from the Ottawa Model of Smoking Cessation, implemented in a major teaching hospital in London, England. The cost-per-patient, cost-per-quit and Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio were estimated for 673 patients who smoked and who received the intervention after being admitted to one of 11 acute wards between July 2020 and June 2021. Patient-level readmission costs and bed-days from six months after discharge were compared between the intervention group and a group of benchmark patients who smoked and who did not receive the intervention. The total cost of the intervention was 178,105. On the basis of 104 patients who reported not smoking at six months, the cost-per-quit was 1712.55. Among 611 patients who were successfully matched to a benchmark cohort, re-admissions for patients in the intervention group cost 492k less than their benchmark equivalents over 21 months from January 2021 to September 2022 (266k vs 758k), incurred 414 fewer bed days (303 vs 717), and re-admitted at a lower rate (5% vs 11%). Lower readmission rates and costs were associated with the intervention regardless of patient smoking status at six months, except among those who had opted out. A pilot tobacco dependence treatment intervention implemented in an acute hospital setting in London demonstrated value for money through reduced readmission rates and costs among all patients who received it.

J6209,2025,Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage after vaginal birth,"- Rationale Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is common and potentially lifeÃ¢â‚¬Âthreatening. The antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid (TXA) is thought to be effective for treating PPH. There is growing interest in whether TXA is effective for preventing PPH after vaginal birth. In randomised controlled trials (RCTs), TXA has been associated with increased risk of seizures and unexplained increased mortality when given more than three hours after traumatic bleeding. Reliable evidence on the effects, costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness and safety of prophylactic TXA is required before considering widespread use. This review updates one published in 2015. Objectives To assess the effects of TXA for preventing PPH compared to placebo or no treatment (with or without uterotonic coÃ¢â‚¬Âtreatment) in women following vaginal birth. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and WHO ICTRP (to 6 September 2024). We also searched reference lists of retrieved studies. Eligibility criteria We included RCTs evaluating TXA alone or in addition to standard care (uterotonics) for preventing PPH following vaginal birth. For this update, we required trials to be prospectively registered (before participant recruitment), and we applied a trustworthiness checklist. Outcomes Critical outcomes were blood loss Ã¢â€°Â¥ 500 mL and blood loss Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1000 mL. Important outcomes included maternal death, severe morbidity, blood transfusion, receipt of additional surgical interventions to control PPH, thromboembolic events, receipt of additional uterotonics, hysterectomy, and maternal satisfaction. Risk of bias We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the studies. Synthesis methods Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed trial trustworthiness. We used randomÃ¢â‚¬Âeffects metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis to combine data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Included studies We included three RCTs with 18,974 participants in total. The trials were conducted in both highÃ¢â‚¬Â and lowÃ¢â‚¬Âresource settings and involved participants at both low and high risk of PPH. The trials compared intravenous TXA (1 g) and standard care versus placebo (saline) and standard care. After applying our trustworthiness checklist, we did not include any of the 12 trials in the previous version of this review. Synthesis of results Prophylactic tranexamic acid in addition to standard care compared to placebo in addition to standard care TXA results in little to no difference in blood loss Ã¢â€°Â¥ 500 mL (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; 2 studies, 18,897 participants; 5 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 15 fewer to 5 more; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). TXA likely results in little to no difference in blood loss Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1000 mL (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.07; 2 studies, 18,897 participants; 3 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 1 more; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). TXA likely results in little to no difference in severe morbidity (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.12; 1 study, 15,066 participants; 2 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 2 more; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). TXA results in little to no difference in receipt of blood transfusion (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 3 studies, 18,972 participants; 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 10 fewer to 12 more; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). TXA may result in little to no difference in receipt of additional surgical interventions to control PPH (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.23; 2 studies, 18,972 participants; 1 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 2 fewer to 1 more; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). In women with anaemia, TXA results in little to no difference in receipt of additional uterotonics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.10; 1 study, 15,066 participants; 3 more women per 1000, 95% CI 8 fewer to 24 more; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). In women with no anaemia, TXA results in a slight reduction in receipt of additional uterotonics (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.92; 1 study, 3891 participants; 24 fewer women per 1000, 95% CI 38 fewer to 8 fewer; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). TXA likely r sults in little to no difference in maternal satisfaction. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on maternal death, thromboembolic events, and hysterectomy (very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence): maternal death (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.49; 2 studies, 15,081 participants; 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 2 more); thromboembolic events (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.24; 3 studies, 18,774 participants; 3 fewer women per 10,000, 95% CI 4 fewer to 5 more); hysterectomy (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.19; 1 study, 15,066 participants; 1 fewer women per 10,000, 95% CI 9 fewer to 16 more). Authors' conclusions Adding prophylactic TXA to standard care of women during vaginal birth makes little to no difference to blood loss Ã¢â€°Â¥ 500 mL and likely makes little to no difference to blood loss Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1000 mL or the risk of severe morbidity, compared to placebo and standard care. TXA may result in little to no difference in additional surgical interventions to control PPH and results in little to no difference in blood transfusions. One trial found that TXA reduced the use of additional uterotonics in women without anaemia, whereas the largest trial found little to no difference in the use of additional uterotonics in women with anaemia. Although there were very few serious adverse events reported, the evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the effect of TXA on maternal death, thromboembolic events, hysterectomy, or seizures. TXA likely results in little to no difference in maternal satisfaction. These findings are based mainly on two large trials. In the smaller of these, less than 30% of study participants were at high risk of PPH. In the largest trial, all participants had moderate to severe anaemia. Those making decisions about routine administration of prophylactic TXA for all women having vaginal births should consider that current evidence does not show a benefit of TXA for blood loss outcomes and related morbidity, and the evidence is very uncertain about serious adverse events.

Registration Protocol (2009) DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007872Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Original review (2010) DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub2Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Review update (2015) DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007872.pub3 Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of tranexamic acid for preventing heavy bleeding after vaginal birth? Key messages Tranexamic acid given as a preventive treatment makes little to no difference to heavy bleeding after vaginal birth. We are uncertain about whether there are any harmful effects from tranexamic acid. What is the issue? Postpartum haemorrhage, which is heavy bleeding after giving birth, is a common and potentially lifeÃ¢â‚¬Âthreatening complication of birthing a child. Most women receive drugs (called uterotonics) that stimulate the womb to contract after a normal (vaginal) delivery to prevent postpartum haemorrhage. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a medication that is used to decrease blood loss in surgery and health conditions associated with increased bleeding. It works by helping to prevent the breakdown of blood clots. If a woman is bleeding heavily after birth, it decreases blood loss. We do not know if TXA can help prevent heavy bleeding after vaginal birth. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether fewer women have heavy bleeding after a vaginal birth if they receive TXA, with or without additional uterotonics, during vaginal birth. We also wanted to find out if taking TXA during vaginal birth was associated with any harmful effects. What did we do? We searched for and selected all the studies that addressed our question. We used a checklist to make sure we only included studies with information we could verify. We made judgements about the quality of the studies before comparing and summarising the results of the studies. Lastly, we rated our confidence in the findings. Why is this important? It is important to determine whether TXA is effective in preventing heavy bleeding after birth when given to women during vaginal birth. If there is a benefit, it could help women around the world and even play a role in reducing the number of women who die after giving birth. How up to date is this evidence? We searched for all available evidence up to 6 September 2024. What evidence did we find? We identified three studies that investigated the effects of preventive TXA. The three studies involved a total of 18,974 participants at low or high risk of heavy bleeding. Participants were given either intravenous (into a vein) TXA plus standard care or placebo (saline) injection plus standard care. We found that preventive TXA results in little to no difference in heavy bleeding after birth. We are very uncertain about the effect of TXA on maternal death. TXA likely makes no difference to the risk of women developing serious illness. We found that TXA has no effect on the likelihood of receiving a blood transfusion. TXA may result in no difference in the need for further surgical intervention after giving birth. We are very uncertain about the effect of TXA on blood clots. In women with anaemia, TXA makes no difference to the need for additional drugs to help the womb contract, but in women with no anaemia, there was a slight reduction in this outcome. We are very uncertain about the effect of TXA on hysterectomy (an operation to remove the womb). There does not seem to be a difference in maternal satisfaction. What are the limitations of the evidence? The studies included women in both highÃ¢â‚¬Â and lowÃ¢â‚¬Âresource settings. Few women experienced harmful effects. However, we cannot be certain that this is indeed the case in the real world. What does this mean? We found no difference in the number of women experiencing heavy bleeding after birth after they were given TXA preventatively during vaginal birth, and we are very uncertain about the effect of TXA on blood clots and other serious side effects. As these are harmful effects, clinicians should take into account the lack of benefit and the potential harms when considering giving routine TXA to women during vaginal birth.

J6211,2025,"Clinical pathways for secondary care and the effects on professional practice, patient outcomes, length of stay and hospital costs","- Background Clinical pathways (CPWs) are structured multidisciplinary care plans. They aim to translate evidence into practice and optimize clinical outcomes. This is the first update of the previous systematic review ( Rotter 2010 ). Objectives To investigate the effect of CPWs on patient outcomes, length of stay, costs and charges, adherence to recommended practice, and to measure the impact of different approaches to implementation of CPWs. Search methods For this update, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase were searched on 25 July 2024. Two trial registries were searched on 26 July 2024, along with reference checking, citation searching and contacting authors to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We considered two groups of participants: health professionals involved in CPW utilization, including (but not limited to) physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, occupational therapists and social workers; and patients managed using a CPW. We included randomized trials, nonÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized trials, controlled beforeÃ¢â‚¬Âafter (CBA) studies, and interrupted timeÃ¢â‚¬Âseries (ITS) studies comparing (1) standÃ¢â‚¬Âalone clinical pathways with usual care, and (2) clinical pathways as part of a multifaceted intervention with usual care. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently screened all titles, abstracts and fullÃ¢â‚¬Âtext manuscripts to assess eligibility and the methodological quality of included studies using the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organization of Care 'Risk of Bias' tool. Certainty of evidence was assessed by two authors independently. Interventions were scored as 'high', 'moderate' or 'low' for the evidenceÃ¢â‚¬Âbased implementation process. Main results The update provided 31 additional studies for a total of 58 included studies (24,841 patients and 2027 healthcare professionals). FortyÃ¢â‚¬Âone (71%) were randomized trials, four (7%) nonÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized trials, four (7%) CBA studies and nine (16%) ITS studies. FortyÃ¢â‚¬Ânine studies compared standÃ¢â‚¬Âalone CPWs to usual care and nine compared multifaceted interventions including a CPW to usual care. Collectively, the risk of bias was high due to potential contamination by healthcare professionals, lack of blinding of patients and personnel, lack of allocation concealment and selective reporting in ITS studies. StandÃ¢â‚¬Âalone clinical pathway interventions It is uncertain whether standÃ¢â‚¬Âalone CPWs reduce inhospital mortality (13% v 16%: OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.20; P = 0.27; IÃ‚Â² = 65%; 7 randomized trials; n = 4603; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to serious imprecision and inconsistency) or mortality (up to 6 months) (4% v 3%: OR 1.37, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.60; P = 0.34; IÃ‚Â² = 20%; 3 randomized trials, n = 805; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to serious risk of bias and imprecision). StandÃ¢â‚¬Âalone CPWs likely reduce inhospital complications (10% v 17%: OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.80; P = 0.001; IÃ‚Â² = 52%; 11 randomized trials, n = 3668; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to serious risk of bias). It is very uncertain whether standÃ¢â‚¬Âalone CPWs reduce hospital readmissions (up to 6 months) (9% v 13%: OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.03; P = 0.07; IÃ‚Â² = 11%; 9 randomized trials, n = 1578; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision). StandÃ¢â‚¬Âalone CPWs likely reduce the length of hospital stay compared to usual care (MD Ã¢â‚¬Â1.12 days, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â1.60 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.65; P < 0.00001; IÃ‚Â² = 64%; 21 studies; n = 5201; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to serious inconsistency). Costs and charges were generally lower in CPWs as indicated by negative MDs in nine studies (10 studies, n = 2113, data not pooled; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to serious indirectness and very serious inconsistency). StandÃ¢â‚¬Âalone CPWs may slightly increase adherence to recommended practice compared with usual care (3 randomized studies, n = 573; data not pooled; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to serious risk of bias and serious inconsistency). Multifaceted clinical pathway interventions It is uncertain whether multifaceted CPWs reduce inhospital mor ality (2 randomized studies, n = 6304, data not pooled; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to very serious inconsistency). Multifaceted CPWs may make little or no difference to mortality (up to 6 months) (9% v 8%: OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.25; P = 0.61; IÃ‚Â² = 0%; 3 randomized studies; n = 6531; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to serious imprecision and serious risk of bias). It is uncertain whether multifaceted CPWs reduce inhospital complications (9% v 23%: OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.87; 1 study, n = 140; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to very serious imprecision). It is uncertain whether multifaceted CPWs reduce hospital readmission (up to 6 months) (2 randomized studies, n =1569, data not pooled; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to very serious inconsistency), or length of stay (4 randomized studies, n = 1936, data not pooled; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to very serious inconsistency), or hospital costs and charges (4 randomized studies, n = 2015, data not pooled; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to very serious imprecision and serious indirectness in outcome measures). It is uncertain whether multifaceted CPWs increase adherence to recommended practice (2 randomized studies, n = 6304, data not pooled, lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence due to very serious inconsistency). Key study characteristics The highest proportion of included studies were from the USA (36%), followed by Australia (10%), China (10%), Japan (5%), the UK (5%), Canada (5%), Italy (5%), and Germany (5%). More than half of the included studies tested CPW in general acute wards (53%), followed by emergency departments (17%), intensive care (14%), and extendedÃ¢â‚¬Âstay facilities (10%). The most common clinical conditions were asthma (16%), stroke (10%), mechanical ventilation (9%) and myocardial infarction (7%). Authors' conclusions StandÃ¢â‚¬Âalone CPWs are likely to reduce inhospital complications and length of hospital stay and may slightly increase adherence to recommended practice. There was little conclusive evidence for multifaceted CPWs due to mixed results from a limited number of included studies. It is uncertain whether standÃ¢â‚¬Âalone CPWs or CPWs, as part of a multifaceted approach, reduce inhospital mortality, mortality (up to 6 months), hospital readmission (up to 6 months) or costs and charges. Plain language summary Effects of clinical pathways in hospitals on patient outcomes, length of hospital stay, hospital costs and charges, and adherence to recommended practice. What is the aim of this review? Clinical pathways (CPW) are documentÃ¢â‚¬Âbased tools that provide a link between the best available evidence and clinical practice. They provide recommendations, processes and time frames for the management of specific medical conditions or interventions. This review update aimed to summarize the evidence and assess the effect of clinical pathways on patient outcomes (inhospital mortality, mortality (up to 6 months), inhospital complications, and hospital readmissions (up to 6 months)), length of hospital stay, hospital costs and charges, and professional practice (i.e. healthcare professionals adhering to recommended practice), compared to hospital care as usual. Also, we identified and compared different implementation strategies. We included patients in hospitals that were treated according to (1) the recommendations of a CPW, or (2) a CPW that has been implemented together with other interventions, such as a case manager or quality improvement initiatives. We analyzed 58 studies (24,841 patients and 2027 healthcare professionals), of which 27 were included in a previously published review (Rotter 2010) and 31 were retrieved for this update. This is the first update of the previous review. Key messages CPWs might have the potential to improve patient outcomes, and they may reduce length of hospital stay, hospital costs, and improve adherence to recommended practice. But we still need more highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality studies that report on implementation strategies used during the pathway development and implementation. What was studied in the review? DecisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking in hospitals h s evolved from being opinionÃ¢â‚¬Âbased to being based on sound scientific evidence (i.e. evidenceÃ¢â‚¬Âbased practice). Hospitals incorporate evidence into clinical pathways for health professionals to follow. They have been implemented worldwide but the evidence about their impact from single trials is contradictory. Perpetual publication of new evidence combined with the demands of everyday practice makes it difficult for health professionals to keep up to date. Included study designs were individual and clusterÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized studies, nonÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized studies, controlled beforeÃ¢â‚¬Âafter studies (CBA), and interrupted timeÃ¢â‚¬Âseries studies (ITS). In individual randomized trials, study participants were allocated to the CPW or usual care group by chance, called random allocation. ClusterÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized trials divided all study participants into smaller groups known as clusters. These clusters were then allocated by chance to the CPW or usual care group. For nonÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized trials, participants were allocated to different groups by investigators in a quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandom fashion. QuasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandom allocation means that study participants were allocated to the CPW or usual care group based on criteria such as their date of birth or the day of the week. CBA studies are experimental studies without a random or quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandom allocation process. Data are collected from the CPW and usual care group before the CPW was implemented, and then further data were collected after the CPW was introduced. ITS studies represent a robust method of measuring the effect of a CPW as a trend over time. All included studies tested the impact of clinical pathways used in hospitals on one or more of the prespecified outcomes: inhospital mortality, mortality (up to 6 months), inhospital complications, hospital readmissions (up to 6 months), length of hospital stay, hospital costs and charges, and adherence to recommended practice. Studies focused on the change in outcome measures following the implementation of a standÃ¢â‚¬Âalone clinical pathway or a multifaceted clinical pathway combined with other interventions compared to usual care. What are the main results of the review? We found 58 studies that measured the effects of clinical pathways on included outcomes. The main results are that, compared to usual care, it is uncertain if the implementation of a standÃ¢â‚¬Âalone clinical pathway has any effect on inÃ¢â‚¬Âhospital mortality and mortality (up to 6 months) (low certainty). StandÃ¢â‚¬Âalone CPWs are likely to reduce inhospital complications (moderate certainty) but it is very uncertain if they make any difference to hospital readmissions (up to 6 months) (very low certainty). StandÃ¢â‚¬Âalone CPWs are likely to reduce length of hospital stay (moderate certainty). Costs and charges were generally lower in CPWs in nine out of ten studies included in this comparison (very low certainty). StandÃ¢â‚¬Âalone CPWs may also slightly increase adherence to recommended practice (low certainty). For multifaceted clinical pathways compared to usual care, it is uncertain whether there is a reduction in inhospital mortality (low certainty) and they may make little or no difference to mortality (up to 6 months) (low certainty). It is uncertain whether CPWs that have been combined with other interventions reduce inhospital complications (low certainty) or hospital readmissions (up to 6 months) (low certainty). It is also uncertain if they reduce length of hospital stay (low certainty), hospital costs and charges (very low certainty), and adherence to recommended practice (low certainty), compared to usual care.

J6212,2025,"Cost-effectiveness of BOOST online intervention for supported self-management of pain, fatigue and bowel incontinence in Inflammatory Bowel Disease","Background: People with IBD often experience symptoms of abdominal pain, fatigue and bowel incontinence that affect substantially their daily lives1 . IBD-BOOST is the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing the effectiveness of an online self-management intervention, BOOST, in managing these symptoms in IBD2 . We report the cost-effectiveness of BOOST intervention compared to care as usual for people with IBD. Method(s): A cost-utility analysis was conducted alongside the pragmatic IBD-BOOST RCT of 780 patients requesting help for pain, fatigue or incontinence symptoms (mean age 49 years, 67% women, 55% with Crohn's disease)3 . The BOOST intervention costs and costs from patient-reported health service use, out-of-pocket expenses and time off work were calculated for each participant over the 12 months of follow-up. Qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs) over the 12 months were evaluated using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaires administered to participants at baseline, 6- and 12-months. Missing data (13% at 6 months and 38% at 12 months across the trial arms) was imputed using multiple imputation. Differences in total costs and QALYs between study arms were estimated using mixed effects models adjusting for pre-specified baseline factors. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net monetary benefit from UK healthcare and societal perspectives are reported. Result(s): At recruitment, study participants reported quality of life (EQ-5D utility) of 0.73 (SD 0.22) and overall IBD-related costs of 2321 (SD 3170) over the previous 3 months with cost of biologics accounting for 47% of these costs, followed by hospital outpatient services (22%) and work productivity loss costs (14%) (Figure 1). After missing data imputation and controlling for covariates, the BOOST intervention (151 per participant) was estimated to have led to health care cost savings of 746 (SE 356), other costs savings of 89 (SE 236) and incremental QALYs of 0.017 (SE 0.007) over the one-year follow-up per participant resulting in cost savings per QALY gained of 34,599 from the health services perspective and 39,745 from the societal perspective. The probability that the BOOST intervention was cost effective when compared with usual care was above 98% for willingness-to-pay thresholds of 20,000 to 30,000 from both health services and societal perspectives (Figure 2). Conclusion(s): Our findings indicate that the BOOST intervention for supported self-management of symptoms of pain, fatigue and bowel incontinence in people with IBD is cost-effective.

J6213,2025,Can home-exercise programmes delivered via a handout format result in sufficient adherence among patients with musculoskeletal conditions/injuries? A systematic review,"Purpose: Musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions and injuries are a leading cause of disability globally, with the prevalence continuing to rise due to an increasing ageing population. This consequently increases the demands placed on health services to manage widespread physical disability to support those affected. In the UK, the NHS spends approximately 5bn a year treating MSK conditions, accounting for one of the largest areas of NHS expenditure and the biggest areas of workload. Home exercise programmes (HEPs) are a key component of evidence-based management of MSK conditions. However, effectiveness of treatment relies on patient adherence to these exercise programmes with the wider literature suggesting non-adherence rates may be as high as 70%. Adherence to physiotherapy interventions proves to be a complex issue and the reasons for poor adherence are shown to be multi-faceted. An avenue of exploration is the method of HEP delivery, which traditionally has been by verbal instruction often with a paper handout, although the use of digitised methods (e.g. smartphone Apps) are becoming more popular. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to understand if sufficient HEP adherence can be achieved when delivered via a printed format compared to alternate methods or physiotherapy interventions, specifically among adults treated for a MSK condition/injury. Method(s): This systematic review conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Six databases were searched from inception to April 2024: CINAHL, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO and PubMed. Randomised clinical trials comparing HEPs delivered via paper handout versus alternate delivery methods or physiotherapy interventions, and the effect on adherence rates, were included. Methodological quality and certainty of evidence were assessed by one reviewer using the Cochrane RoB2 tool and modified GRADE approach, respectively. Result(s): Fifteen studies were included for review, categorised based on the type of intervention compared to paper handout, e.g., smart-device Apps/other digitised methods, supervised exercise, SMS/phone reminders. The findings suggest that while the use of paper handouts is superior to verbal instruction alone, Apps with more extensive functionalities, such as, remote monitoring, self-recording abilities and reminder notifications may promote even greater HEP adherence rates. However, studies were either of 'some concern' or 'high' risk of bias, and the overall quality (certainty) of evidence was determined to be 'low', meaning the ability to draw firm conclusions and recommendations is limited. Conclusion(s): Apps may potentially facilitate better adherence rates, but further high-quality research is required to firmly recommend a HEP delivery method. Clinicians should tailor their approaches specific to patients' needs and profiles, gaining an understanding of their patients' previous experiences, expectations and self-efficacy. Impact: The project highlights the need for more high-quality research in this important area of exercise therapy adherence. Methods of improving the currently poor adherence rates need to be established. Cost-effectiveness of such methods should also be researched prior to any widespread implementation. Facilitating better patient adherence with home-exercise treatment can lead to improved patient outcomes and self-management, which in turn can reduce healthcare provider burden and expenditure.

J6218,2025,Direct factor Xa inhibitors versus low molecular weight heparins or vitamin K antagonists for prevention of venous thromboembolism in elective primary hip or knee replacement or hip fracture repair,"- Background People undergoing major orthopaedic surgery are at increased risk of postoperative thromboembolic events. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are recommended for thromboprophylaxis in this population. New oral anticoagulants, including direct factor Xa inhibitors, are recommended as alternatives. They may have more advantages than disadvantages compared to LMWHs and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, another type of anticoagulant). Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of prophylactic anticoagulation with direct factor Xa inhibitors compared with low molecular weight heparins and vitamin K antagonists in people undergoing major orthopaedic surgery for elective total hip or knee replacement or hip fracture surgery. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trial registers to 11 November 2023. We conducted reference checks to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of direct factor Xa inhibitors to LMWHs or VKAs in people undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality, major venous thromboembolism (VTE), symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and serious hepatic and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âhepatic adverse events. We evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies using Cochrane's risk of bias 1 tool. We calculated estimates of treatment effects using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included 53 RCTs (44,371 participants). Participants' average age was 64 years (range: 18 to 93 years). Only one RCT compared a VKA with direct factor Xa inhibitors. All 53 RCTs compared direct factor Xa inhibitors with LMWHs. TwentyÃ¢â‚¬Âthree studies included participants undergoing total hip replacement; 21 studies, total knee replacement; and three studies included people having hip fracture surgery. The studies' average duration was approximately 42 days (range: two to 720 days). Compared to LMWHs, direct factor Xa inhibitors may have little to no effect on allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.31; I 2 = 0%; 28 studies, 29,698 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Direct factor Xa inhibitors may make little to no difference to major venous thromboembolic events compared to LMWHs, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; absolute risk difference: 12 fewer major VTE events per 1000 participants, 95% CI 16 fewer to 7 fewer; I 2 = 48%; 28 studies, 24,574 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Compared to LMWHs, direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce symptomatic VTE (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.83; I 2 = 0%; 33 studies, 31,670 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The absolute benefit of substituting factor Xa inhibitors for LMWHs may be between two and five fewer symptomatic VTE episodes per 1000 patients. In the metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis with all studies pooled, direct factor Xa inhibitors appeared to make little or no difference to major bleeding compared to LMWHs, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30; I 2 = 15%; 36 studies, 39,778 participants; very low certaintyÃ¢â‚¬Âevidence). Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ In a subgroup analysis limited to studies comparing rivaroxaban to LMWHs, people given rivaroxaban may have had more major bleeding events (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.98; I 2 = 0%; 17 studies, 17,630 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The absolute risk of substituting rivaroxaban for LMWH may be between one and seven more major bleeding events per 1000 patients. Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ In a subgroup analysis limited to studies comparing direct factor Xa inhibitors other than rivaroxaban to LMWHs, people given these other direct factor Xa inhibitors may have had fewer major bleeding events, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.02; absolute risk difference: 3 fewer major bl eding events per 1000 participants, 95% CI 5 fewer to 0 fewer; I 2 = 0%; 19 studies, 22,148 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Direct factor Xa inhibitors may make little to no difference in serious hepatic adverse events compared to LMWHs, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 3.01, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.93; 2 studies, 3169 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Only two studies reported this outcome, with one death in the intervention group due to hepatitis reported in one study, and no events reported in the other study. People given direct factor Xa inhibitors may have a lower risk of serious nonÃ¢â‚¬Âhepatic adverse events than those given LMWHs (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; I 2 = 18%; 15 studies, 26,246 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The absolute benefit of substituting factor Xa inhibitors for LMWH may be between three and 14 fewer serious nonÃ¢â‚¬Âhepatic adverse events per 1000 patients. Only one study compared a direct factor Xa inhibitor with a VKA. It reported outcome data with imprecise results due to the small number of events. It showed no difference in the effects of the study drugs. Authors' conclusions Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may have little to no effect on allÃ¢â‚¬Âcause mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may slightly reduce symptomatic VTE events when compared with LMWH. They may make little or no difference to major VTE events, but the evidence is very uncertain. In the evaluation of major bleeding, the evidence suggests rivaroxaban results in a slight increase in major bleeding events compared to LMWHs. The remaining oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may have little to no effect on major bleeding, but the evidence is very uncertain. Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce serious nonÃ¢â‚¬Âhepatic adverse events slightly compared to LMWHs. They may have little to no effect on serious hepatic adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain. Due to the high rates of missing participants and selective outcome reporting, the effect estimates may be biased. Plain language summary Direct factor Xa inhibitors or classic 'blood thinners': which leads to better outcomes for people undergoing major hip or knee surgery? Key messages Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ We do not know if classic anticoagulant medicines (commonly known as 'blood thinners') or newer bloodÃ¢â‚¬Âthinning medicines called 'direct factor Xa inhibitors' (DFXa inhibitors) are better at preventing death or the development of blood clots in the deep veins of the legs or in the lungs of people who have had hip or knee replacement surgery. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Compared to classic anticoagulants, DFXa inhibitors may slightly reduce the number of people who experience blood clot symptoms (such as breathing difficulties or pain). One type of DFXa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, may slightly increase the number of people who have serious uncontrolled bleeding. Why are blood clots a concern for people having major hip or knee surgery? 'Venous thromboembolism' is when a blood clot forms in a vein, the vessels that carry blood back to the heart. Clots can narrow or block veins, leading to tissue damage, stroke, and death. People having hip or knee replacement surgery, or an operation to fix a broken hip, are at a higher risk of developing a blood clot. How can blood clots be prevented and treated? People undergoing major hip or knee surgery are typically given an anticoagulant medicine, commonly known as a 'blood thinner', to help prevent blood clots from forming. There are two main types of 'classic' anticoagulants: (1) low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), which are injected with a needle at a fixed dose; and (2) vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), given by mouth in variable amounts. Newer anticoagulant medicines known as direct factor Xa inhibitors have been developed. They are given by mouth in fixed doses. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are types of DFXa inhibitors. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if DFXa inhibitors were better than classic anticoagulants at reducing the number of people who (1) died from any cause aft r major hip or knee surgery, and (2) developed blood clots or symptoms of blood clots (e.g. breathing difficulties and pain). We also wanted to find out if DFXa inhibitors were associated with any unwanted effects, including uncontrolled bleeding, serious liver disease, and other serious unwanted events. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared DFXa inhibitors with classic anticoagulants in people undergoing hip or knee surgery. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 53 studies that involved 44,371 adults who had hip or knee replacement surgery, and had a high risk of developing blood clots in their lungs, legs, or pelvis. They received anticoagulant treatment for 6 to 39 days, and followÃ¢â‚¬Âup lasted for an average of 42 days. All 53 studies compared DFXa inhibitors with low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). Just one study also investigated the VKA called warfarin. The biggest study involved 5407 participants, and the smallest study, 50 participants. They were conducted in countries unevenly distributed around the world; most were done in highÃ¢â‚¬Âincome regions. Roughly oneÃ¢â‚¬Âthird of participants (31%) were male. Participants' average age was 64 years. Pharmaceutical companies funded half of the studies (27 of 53). Main results Compared to LMWHs, we do not know if DFXa inhibitors reduce the number of people who:Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ die from any cause after surgery, orÃ¢â‚¬Â¨Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ develop blood clots in the lungs or deep veins of the leg or pelvisÃ¢â‚¬Â¨because the evidence is very uncertain. Compared to LMWHs, DFXa inhibitors may slightly reduce the number of people who have blood clot symptoms: between 2 and 5 fewer people out of every 1000 people given DFXa inhibitors would have blood clot symptoms compared to people given LMWHs. The DFXa inhibitor rivaroxaban may slightly increase the number of people who have major uncontrolled bleeding compared to LMWHs. Between 1 and 7 more people out of every 1000 people given rivaroxaban may have uncontrolled bleeding compared to those given LMWHs. The other DFXa inhibitors may have little to no effect on major bleeding, but the evidence is very uncertain. Compared to LMWHs, DFXa inhibitors may have little to no effect on serious unwanted events affecting the liver, but the evidence is very uncertain. They may slightly reduce other serious, nonÃ¢â‚¬ÂliverÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated events compared to LMWHs. Between 3 and 14 fewer people out of every 1000 people given DFXa inhibitors would have serious, nonÃ¢â‚¬ÂliverÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated events compared to people given LMWHs. We did not find enough studies investigating VKAs to help us answer our questions. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have little confidence in the evidence because people in some studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Most studies did not have a complete set of results for all participants.

<b>RESULTS</b>: On average, NPWT was associated with higher costs and marginally higher QALYs than standard dressings. The cost difference was mainly driven by the additional intervention costs associated with NPWT. The estimated probability of NPWT being cost-effective was <30%.

J6222,2025,The clinical and cost effectiveness of a STAndardised DIagnostic Assessment for children and adolescents with emotional difficulties: the STADIA multi-centre randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Standardised Diagnostic Assessment tools, such as the Development and Well-Being Assessment (DAWBA), may aid detection and diagnosis of emotional disorders but there is limited real-world evidence of their clinical or cost effectiveness. METHOD(S): We conducted a multicentre, two-arm parallel group randomised controlled trial in eight large National Health Service Trusts in England providing multidisciplinary specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Participants (5-17 year-olds with emotional difficulties referred to CAMHS) were randomly assigned (1:1), following referral receipt, to either receive the DAWBA and assessment-as-usual (intervention group) or assessment-as-usual (control group). Data were self-reported by participants (parents and/or young person, depending on age) at baseline, 6- and 12-month post-randomisation and collected from clinical records up to 18 months post-randomisation. The primary outcome was a clinician-made diagnosis decision about the presence of an emotional disorder within 12 months of randomisation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN15748675. RESULT(S): In total, 1,225 children and young people (58% female sex) were randomised (615 intervention; 610 control). Adherence to the intervention (full/partial completion) was 80% (494/615). At 12 months, 68 (11%) participants in the intervention group received an emotional disorder diagnosis versus 72 (12%) in the control group (adjusted risk ratio (RR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.70, 1.28]). The intervention was not cost effective. There was no evidence of any differences between groups for service-related or participant-reported secondary outcomes, for example, CAMHS acceptance of the index referral (intervention 277 (45%) versus control 262 (43%); RR: 1.06 [95% CI: 0.94, 1.19]) was similar between groups. CONCLUSION(S): As delivered in this pragmatic trial, we found no evidence for the effectiveness or cost effectiveness of using a Standardised Diagnostic Assessment tool in aiding the detection of emotional disorders or clinical outcomes in clinically referred children and young people. Despite regular efforts to encourage clinicians to view the DAWBA report and consider its findings as part of assessment and diagnosis, we did not collect data on usage and therefore cannot confirm the extent to which clinicians did this. As a pragmatic trial that aimed to test the effectiveness of incorporating the DAWBA into usual practice and clinical care, our study found that, in the format as delivered in this trial, there was no impact on diagnosis or clinical outcomes.

J6223,2025,Rapid tests to inform triage and antibiotic prescribing decisions for adults presenting with suspected acute respiratory infection: a rapid evidence synthesis of clinical effectiveness and cost-utility studies,"<b>Background</b>: This review assessed the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of point-of-care tests to guide the initial management of people presenting with suspected acute respiratory infection.
<b>Methods</b>: Searches for systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials and cost-utility studies were conducted in May 2023. Sources included MEDLINE, Epistemonikos, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cost-effectiveness Analysis Registry and reference checking. Eligible studies included people (>= 16 years) making initial contact with the health system with symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory infection. Risk of bias in randomised controlled trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The Drummond checklist was used for cost-utility studies. Meta-analyses of clinical outcomes were conducted to estimate summary risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Study characteristics and main results were summarised narratively and tabulated.
<b>Results</b>: Fourteen randomised controlled trials were included; all had a high risk of bias. Ten randomised controlled trials analysed point-of-care tests for C-reactive protein. Compared with usual care, the effects on hospital admissions and mortality were highly uncertain due to sparse data. Three randomised controlled trials had heterogeneous findings on the resolution of symptoms/time to full recovery. The risk of re-consultations increased in patients receiving C-reactive protein point-of-care tests (pooled risk ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.41; four studies). There was a reduction in antibiotics initially prescribed (C-reactive protein point-of-care tests vs. usual care: pooled risk ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 0.84; nine studies). The effects of procalcitonin point-of-care tests compared with usual care on hospital admission, escalation of care, and duration of symptoms were very uncertain as only one randomised controlled trial was included. The study found a large reduction in antibiotic prescriptions within 7 days. Two studies revealed a large reduction in initial antibiotic prescriptions for Group A streptococcus point-of-care tests versus usual care. Only one study compared an influenza point-of-care test with usual care. The effect of the antibiotics prescribed was very uncertain. No deaths occurred in either treatment group.
<b>Cost-effectiveness</b>: Six of the 17 included cost-utility studies were judged to be directly applicable to our review, 4 of which focused on the C-reactive protein point-of-care test. The results suggested that the C-reactive protein point-of-care test is potentially cost-effective; these studies were generally limited to capturing only short-term costs and consequences. One study evaluated 14 different point-of-care tests for Group A streptococcus; none were cost-effective compared with usual care. A further study evaluated two rapid tests (Quidel for influenza [Quidel Corp, San Diego, CA, USA], and BinaxNOW [Binax, Inc., Portland, ME, USA]) for the pneumococcal antigen) compared to culture/serology and found that they were not cost-effective.
<b>Limitations</b>: Rapid synthesis methods were used, so relevant studies may have been missed. No evidence was identified for several review questions.
<b>Conclusion</b>: C-reactive protein point-of-care test may reduce the number of patients given an antibiotic prescription but could increase the rate of re-consultations. C-reactive protein point-of-care test may potentially be cost-effective but existing estimates were based on very small and uncertain gains in quality-adjusted life-years and only accounted for short-term costs and consequences. There was very limited or an absence of evidence for other point-of-care tests.
<b>Future work</b>: Research is needed to explore the impact of point-of-care tests on triaging decisions across different clinical settings and to quantify the longer-term health and cost consequences.

J6224,2025,Randomised controlled trial testing clinical and cost-effectiveness of the Live Well self-management toolkit for people with Parkinson's and their carers,"Background: Self-management interventions provide information and tools to people with long-term conditions to help them manage their own condition. They have been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare utilisation. Whilst charities and healthcare providers offer information and advice, there is no effective comprehensive self-management intervention available for people in the UK living with Parkinson's. Through co-design with people with Parkinson's, carers and healthcare professionals, systematic reviews, and qualitative studies, we developed the self-management Live Well with Parkinson's toolkit, facilitated by trained supporters. The toolkit contains information about symptoms, therapies, ways to optimise wellbeing, and practical advice. There are personalised sections covering information about themselves, their health and support, a calendar, to do lists, the ability to review and track symptoms, and an asset-based wellbeing section to identify health priorities they wanted to maintain. Method(s): This toolkit was tested in a single-blind randomised controlled trial in England. Participants were community-dwelling individuals, with a diagnosis of Parkinson's and randomised 1:1 to receive the Live Well with Parkinson's toolkit or treatment as usual. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (PDQ-39) at 12 months with a range of secondary outcome measures. Outcomes are being analysed using linear mixed models, controlling for baseline scores. Result(s): We recruited 346 participants between January 2022-July 2023 with a median age 71 years (IQR 11.25),159 (46%) women, and 297 (86%) White British. Data collection was completed in August 2024 with a retention rate of 88% at 12-month follow-up. The process evaluation revealed highly positive feedback. Clinical and cost-effectiveness analysis will be available for presentation at the conference, including primary and secondary outcomes. Conclusion(s): The outcomes of this programme will inform the effectiveness of this intervention, as well as the effective components, mechanisms, and future developments to improve quality of life for people with Parkinson's when using self-management tools.

J6228,2025,"Implementation strategies for WHO guidelines to prevent, detect, and treat postpartum hemorrhage","- Rationale Despite World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for preventing, detecting, and treating postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), effective implementation has lagged. Objectives To evaluate the clinical benefits and harms of implementation strategies used to promote adherence to WHO clinical guidelines for the prevention, detection, and treatment of PPH. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and two trial registries, along with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors. The latest search date was 25 April 2024. Eligibility criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster, pragmatic, and steppedÃ¢â‚¬Âwedge designs, and nonÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized studies of interventions (NRSIs), including interrupted time series (ITS) studies, controlled beforeÃ¢â‚¬Âafter (CBA) studies, and followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (cohort) studies containing concurrent controls that focused on or described implementation strategies of WHO guidelines for the prevention, detection, and treatment of PPH. Participants were birth attendants and people giving birth in a hospital or healthcare facility. We excluded studies that did not implement a WHO PPH recommendation, had no comparator group, or did not report clinical/implementation outcomes. Outcomes Our critical outcomes were: adherence to WHOÃ¢â‚¬Ârecommended guidelines for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment; PPH Ã¢â€°Â¥ 500 mL; PPH Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1000 mL; additional uterotonics within 24 hours after birth; blood transfusions; maternal death; severe morbidities (major surgery; admission to intensive care unit [ICU]); and adverse effects (variable and related to the clinical intervention) during hospitalization for birth. Our important outcomes were: breastfeeding at discharge; implementation outcomes such as acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability of the implementation strategy; and health professional outcomes such as knowledge and skill. Risk of bias We used the RoB 2 and ROBINSÃ¢â‚¬ÂI tools to assess risk of bias in RCTs and NRSIs, respectively. Synthesis methods Two review authors independently selected studies, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias and trustworthiness. Due to the nature of the data, we reported relevant results for each comparison and outcome but did not attempt quantitative synthesis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Included studies We included 13 studies (9 clusterÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCTs and 4 NRSIs) with a total of 1,027,273 births and more than 4373 birth attendants. The included studies were conducted in 17 different countries. Most trials were conducted in resourceÃ¢â‚¬Âlimited settings. None of the included studies reported data on the use of additional uterotonics within 24 hours after birth or adverse effects. Synthesis of results SingleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent implementation strategies versus usual care for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment We do not know if singleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent implementation strategies have any effect on adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations, PPH Ã¢â€°Â¥ 500 mL, PPH Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1000 mL, or blood transfusion (very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). LowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence suggests that singleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent implementation strategies may have little to no effect on maternal death (86,788 births, 3 trials); may increase severe morbidity related to ICU admission (26,985 births, 1 trial); and may reduce severe morbidity related to surgical outcomes (26,985 births, 1 trial). No trials in this comparison measured the effect on adherence to WHO treatment guidelines. Multicomponent implementation strategies versus usual care for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment We do not know if multicomponent implementation strategies have any effect on adherence to WHO PPH treatment recommendations, PPH Ã¢â€°Â¥ 500 mL, blood transfusion, or severe morbidity relating to surgical outcomes (very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Multicomponent implementation strategies may have little to no effect on matern l death (274,008 births, 2 trials; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) compared to usual care. No trials in this comparison measured the effect on adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations, PPH Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1000 mL, or severe morbidity (outcomes related to ICU admission). Multicomponent implementation strategies versus enhanced usual care for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment LowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence suggests that multicomponent implementation strategies may improve adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations (14,718 births, 2 trials) and adherence to WHO PPH treatment recommendations (356,913 births, 2 trials) compared to enhanced usual care. Multicomponent implementation strategies probably have little to no effect on maternal death (224,850 births, 2 trials; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), severe morbidity related to ICU admission (224,850 births, 2 trials; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), and surgical morbidity (210,132 births, 1 trial; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) compared to enhanced usual care. We do not know if multicomponent implementation strategies affect PPH Ã¢â€°Â¥ 500 mL, PPH Ã¢â€°Â¥ 1000 mL, or blood transfusion (very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Multicomponent implementation strategies may improve adherence to WHO PPH prevention and treatment recommendations, but they probably result in little to no difference in ICU admissions, surgical morbidity, or maternal death. The majority of available evidence is of low to very low certainty, thus we cannot draw any robust conclusions on the effects of implementation strategies for WHO guidelines to prevent, detect, and treat PPH. While all included studies used the implementation strategy of 'train and educate,' the effects seem to be limited when used as a single strategy. Additional research using pragmatic, hybrid effectivenessÃ¢â‚¬Âimplementation study designs that measure implementation outcomes simultaneously alongside clinical outcomes would be beneficial to understand contextual factors, barriers, and facilitators that affect implementation.

Registration Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42024563802) available via https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024563802 Plain language summary What are the best strategies to implement World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to prevent, detect, and treat postpartum hemorrhage? Key messages Multicomponent implementation strategies may improve adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) prevention recommendations and probably do not make a difference to intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, need for additional surgeries, or death of the mother. We do not know if multicomponent implementation strategies affect blood loss or blood transfusion. We do not know if singleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent implementation strategies affect adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations, blood loss, or blood transfusion. SingleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent implementation strategies may not make a difference to the death of the mother, may increase ICU admissions, and may reduce the need for additional surgeries. The small number of studies and differences in data collected across included studies limited our ability to draw any conclusions on effective implementation strategies; however, there were varying degrees of success with identical implementation strategies in different studies, highlighting the need for future research in this area. What is postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)? Postpartum hemorrhage is typically defined as blood loss greater than 500 mL within 24 hours after birth. How is PPH prevented, diagnosed, and reated? WHO guidelines recommend oxytocin administration immediately after birth to prevent PPH. Some birth facilities use blood collection drapes and scales to measure blood loss; however, many do not have access to these supplies. The treatment of PPH varies based on the severity, underlying cause, and available resources. Most cases of PPH are treated with medications that cause the uterus to contract. In women who do not respond to this medication, uterine balloon tamponade (where a balloon is inflated in the uterus to compress blood vessels and stop bleeding) or surgery is needed. What are implementation strategies? Implementation strategies are specific techniques used to increase the acceptance, uptake, and sustainability of a clinical practice or program. Examples include engaging individuals and leaders, changing infrastructure, and training and educating and/or supporting birth attendants. How are implementation strategies used to prevent, diagnose, and treat PPH? A wide range of implementation strategies have been used in clinical practice to prevent, diagnose, and treat PPH. Strategies include training and educating skilled birth attendants in evidenceÃ¢â‚¬Âbased practices, introducing new equipment to birth facilities, and developing reporting systems to audit health records and provide feedback to healthcare workers. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know which, if any, implementation strategies of WHO PPH recommendations are effective in facilityÃ¢â‚¬Âbased childbirth settings. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at the effects of implementation strategies of WHO PPH recommendations by birth attendants on people who gave birth in a health facility. We summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find out? We included 13 studies, which were categorized into three groups based on the implementation strategies used: (1) single strategy versus usual care, (2) multiple strategies versus usual care, and (3) multiple strategies versus enhanced usual care. We do not know if singleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent implementation strategies affect adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations, blood loss, or blood transfusion. SingleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent implementation strategies may not make a difference to maternal death, may reduce the need for additional surgeries, but may also increase ICU admissions. Multicomponent implementation strategies may improve adherence to PPH prevention recommendations and probably do not make a difference to ICU admissions, need for additional surgeries, or maternal death. We do not know if multicomponent implementation strategies affect blood loss or blood transfusion. We found that the same implementation strategies and study approach can increase adherence to WHO guidelines in one setting, not make any difference in another, and even reduce adherence in others. Many studies lacked a comprehensive framework that linked implementation efforts with adherence to WHO recommendations and patient outcomes; it is doubtful that multicomponent intervention could address all factors that contribute to PPHÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated illness or death. It remains unknown whether multiple strategies work in a realÃ¢â‚¬Âworld setting. What are the limitations of the evidence? The level of detail of implementation strategies varied, preventing the combining of studies. There were also differences in the people included in the studies according to facility level, volume of births, and type of delivery. Different study contexts made it difficult to measure the true impact of implementation strategies on outcomes. How upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate is this evidence?

J6233,2025,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery versus surgery followed by chemotherapy for initial treatment in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer,"- Rationale Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) presents at an advanced stage in the majority of women. These women require a combination of surgery and chemotherapy for optimal treatment. Conventional treatment has been to perform surgery first and then give chemotherapy. However, there may be advantages to using chemotherapy before surgery. Objectives To assess the advantages and disadvantages of treating women with advanced EOC with chemotherapy before cytoreductive surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)) compared with conventional treatment where chemotherapy follows cytoreductive surgery (primary cytoreductive surgery (PCRS)). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 21 March 2024. We also checked the reference lists of relevant papers for further studies. We contacted the principal investigators of relevant trials for further information. Eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III/IV) who were randomly allocated to treatment groups that compared platinumÃ¢â‚¬Âbased chemotherapy before cytoreductive surgery with platinumÃ¢â‚¬Âbased chemotherapy following cytoreductive surgery. Outcomes We extracted data on overall (OS) and progressionÃ¢â‚¬Âfree survival (PFS), adverse events, surgically related mortality and morbidity, and quality of life outcomes. Risk of bias We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess risk of bias in RCTs. Synthesis methods We conducted metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalyses using randomÃ¢â‚¬Âeffects models (due to heterogeneity between studies) to calculate hazard ratios (HR), risk ratios (RR), mean differences (MD), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all outcomes. We assessed the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach. Included studies We identified a further 1022 titles and abstracts through our searches in this update (958 unique records after further deÃ¢â‚¬Âduplication), adding to the 2227 titles and abstracts identified in previous versions of this review. A total of five RCTs of varying quality and size met the inclusion criteria. We identified no new completed studies in this update, but we did include additional data from existing studies. The studies assessed a total of 1774 women with stage III/IV ovarian cancer randomised to NACT followed by interval cytoreductive surgery (ICRS) or PCRS followed by chemotherapy. We included data from four studies in the metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalyses (1692 participants). Synthesis of results Survival We found little or no difference between groups in OS (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.08; P = 0.49; I 2 = 0%; 4 studies; 1692 women; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and likely little or no difference between groups in PFS (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.08; P = 0.62; I 2 = 0%; 4 studies; 1692 women; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Adverse events Adverse events, surgical morbidity, and quality of life outcomes were variably and incompletely reported across studies. NACT reduces postoperative mortality (0.4% in the NACT group versus 3.3% in the PCRS group) (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.52; P = 0.002; I 2 = 0%; 4 studies; 1542 women; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). There are probably clinically meaningful differences in favour of NACT compared to PCRS in overall surgically related adverse effects (grade 3+ (G3+)) (6% in the NACT group versus 29% in the PCRS group) (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.38; P < 0.001; I 2 = 0%; 2 studies; 435 women; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Organ resection NACT probably results in a large reduction in the need for stoma formation (5.8% in the NACT group versus 20.4% in the PCRS group) (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.74; P = 0.009; I 2 = 70%; 2 studies; 632 women; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and probably reduces the risk of needing bowel resection at the time of surgery (13.0% in the NACT group versus 26.6% in the PCRS group) (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.81; P = 0.007; I 2 84%; 4 studies; 1578 women; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Quality of life Global quality of life on the EORTC QLQÃ¢â‚¬ÂC30 produced imprecise results in three studies, with high levels of heterogeneity (quality of life at six months: MD 6.62, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™2.89 to 16.13; P = 0.17; I 2 = 92%; 3 studies; 559 women; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Overall, functional and symptom scores may be slightly improved for NACT at 6 months, but similar by 12 months, although the differences might not be clinically meaningful. Authors' conclusions The available highÃ¢â‚¬Â to moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence shows there is likely little or no difference in primary survival outcomes between PCRS and NACT for those with advanced EOC who are suitable for either treatment option. NACT reduces the risk of postoperative mortality and likely reduces the risk of serious adverse events, especially those around the time of surgery, and the need for stoma formation. These data should inform women and clinicians (involving specialist gynaecological multidisciplinary teams) and allow treatment to be tailored to the individual patient, taking into account surgical resectability, age, histology, stage, and performance status. Data from an unpublished study and ongoing studies are awaited. Funding This Cochrane review update had no dedicated funding.

Key messages There is little difference in how long women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) survive, whether they have chemotherapy or surgery first. There is probably little difference in how long it takes for EOC to return after treatment. Giving chemotherapy prior to surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and interval cytoreductive surgery (ICRS)) probably reduces some of the risks of surgery; probably halves the risk of needing the bowel removed during surgery; and probably results in a large reduction in the risk of needing a stoma (bowel diverted through the abdominal wall into a bag to collect bowel contents). NACT/ICRS is an alternative to surgery followed by chemotherapy (primary cytoreductive surgery (PCRS) and adjuvant chemotherapy) in women with stage IIIC/IV EOC. Decisions about which treatment to have first will depend on patient preference, how well the woman is at time of diagnosis, the risks of surgery, and the amount and spread of disease. What is epithelial ovarian cancer, and how is it treated? Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer worldwide in females. Around 90% of ovarian cancers are epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), arising from the surface of the ovary or lining of fallopian tubes. Most women with EOC are diagnosed when their cancer is at a late stage, and their disease has spread throughout the abdominal cavity (stage IIIC/IV). Abnormal cells can spread throughout the abdominal cavity even when the primary tumour is microscopic (cannot be seen), attach to other surfaces, and grow over time before they cause symptoms. Although survival rates have improved over the last 20 years, only two in every five women with EOC are alive five years after diagnosis. Treatment for ovarian cancer involves a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. Surgery aims to remove as much visible (macroscopic) cancer as possible. However, with widespread disease, surgery alone is unlikely to cure EOC, and most women will also need chemotherapy, which uses platinumÃ¢â‚¬Âbased medications to treat cells that cannot be removed by surgery (macroscopic disease) or cannot be seen (microscopic disease). Traditionally, chemotherapy was given after surgery (primary cytoreductive surgery (PCRS) and adjuvant chemoth rapy). However, chemotherapy can be used before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and interval cytoreductive surgery (ICRS)). Women who receive NACT and ICRS complete the remaining cycles of chemotherapy following surgery. Why is this important? Women with advanced EOC may be very unwell at diagnosis or may have disease that would require extensive surgery to remove all visible disease, or both. NACT can help to shrink EOC prior to surgery, which might result in women needing less extensive surgery, or being made well enough to undergo surgery. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if giving chemotherapy before surgery was better than doing surgery first. What did we do? We reviewed the evidence on whether NACT and ICRS or PCRS followed by chemotherapy is more effective and safe in women diagnosed with advanced EOC. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We included five studies involving a total of 1774 women. We were able to pool data from four studies (1692 women). These studies compared women who were given NACT/ICRS with women who underwent PCRS prior to chemotherapy. We found little or no difference between treatments in time to death, and probably little or no difference in time to disease regrowth. NACT/ICRS reduces deaths due to surgery and probably reduces the risk of some severe unwanted effects of surgery. NACT/ICRS probably results in a large reduction in the risk of needing a stoma (bowel diverted through the abdominal wall into a bag to collect bowel contents) and probably reduces the risk of needing the bowel removed during surgery (bowel resection). Overall, patient symptoms and quality of life may be slightly better at 6 months after treatment with NACT/ICRS, but this did not differ at 12 months after starting treatment. These differences might not be noticeable to patients. The studies only enrolled women with advanced ovarian cancer (stage IIIC/IV), and many had extensive disease. We await the results of four ongoing studies and one unpublished full publication of a study. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are confident that there is little difference in overall survival (the length of time after diagnosis that a person is still alive) and fewer deaths due to surgery with NACT/ICRS. We are only moderately confident in other results related to survival, unwanted effects, and need for surgery to remove sections of bowel and need for a stoma, because women knew which treatment they were getting. We have little confidence in the quality of life evidence because the studies were done in different types of women, and approaches to surgery have changed over time, although the results of more recent studies are similar.

J6240,2025,In vitro maturation in subfertile women with polycystic ovarian syndrome undergoing assisted reproduction,"- Background Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) occurs in 8% to 13% of all women of reproductive age and 50% of women presenting with infertility (i.e. inability to reach a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse). A proportion of these women ultimately need assisted reproductive technology. In vitro fertilisation (IVF)/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are assisted reproduction techniques used to raise the chances of a pregnancy. In women with PCOS, the supraÃ¢â‚¬Âphysiological doses of gonadotrophins used for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) often result in an exaggerated ovarian response characterised by the development of a large cohort of follicles of uneven quality, retrieval of immature oocytes, and increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). A potentially effective intervention for women with PCOSÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated infertility involves earlier retrieval of immature oocytes at the germinalÃ¢â‚¬Âvesicle stage followed by in vitro maturation (IVM). This is the third update of this Cochrane review on the subject (after the last update on 27 June 2018). Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of IVM followed by IVF or ICSI versus conventional IVF or ICSI among women with PCOS. Search methods On 27 February 2023, we searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Open Grey database. We further searched the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) fertility assessment and treatment guidelines. We also searched reference lists of relevant papers and Google Scholar for any additional trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IVM before IVF or ICSI with conventional IVF or ICSI for infertile women with PCOS, irrespective of language and country of origin. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data from studies, and, where needed, attempted to contact the authors for missing data. Our primary outcomes were live birth per woman randomised and miscarriage. We performed statistical analysis using Review Manager. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE and the risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. Main results We found four published trials suitable for inclusion in this update. The studies involved 810 subfertile women undergoing assisted reproductive technology. Two of four were already included in the previous version of the review, were published as abstracts in international conferences, and were at high risk of bias. The two new studies were at low risk of bias in all domains and in terms of all outcomes. We implemented the randomÃ¢â‚¬Âeffects model for the quantitative analyses and restricted the primary analysis to studies at low risk of bias in all domains. We are very uncertain about the effect of IVM or capacitation IVM (a new biphasic IVM system improving the developmental competence of oocytes) on live birth when compared to IVF when a GnRH antagonist protocol was applied (odds ratio (OR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 1.32; I 2 = 91%; 2 studies, 739 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of live birth following standard IVF is assumed to be 45.7%, then the chance of IVM would be 12.5% to 52.6%. In contrast, IVM or capacitation IVM increases miscarriage per clinical pregnancy (where clinical pregnancy was defined as evidence of a fetal heart beat on ultrasound at seven gestational weeks) in women with PCOS when compared to IVF (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.70; I 2 = 0%; 2 studies, 378 clinical pregnancies; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of miscarriage following standard IVF is assumed to be 20.1%, then the chance using IVM would be 20.4% to 40.4%. Results remained similar when using the risk ratio (RR) as the measure of effect. We are uncertain about the effect of IVM or capacitation IVM on clinical pregnancy when compared to IVF hen a GnRH antagonist protocol was applied (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.70; I 2 = 94%; 2 studies, 739 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The results were similar after pooling the RRs. IVM or capacitation IVM results in a large reduction in the incidence of moderate or severe OHSS as compared to IVF when a GnRH antagonist protocol was applied (OR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.67; I 2 = 0%; 2 studies, 739 participants; highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). This suggests that if the incidence of OHSS following IVF is assumed to be 3.5%, then the incidence with IVM would be 0% to 2.4%. Also, there is probably little to no difference in preterm birth between IVM or capacitation IVM and IVF after the application of a GnRH antagonist protocol (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.52; IÃ‚Â² = 45%; 2 studies, 739 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). As for congenital anomalies, one study reported no events, while another showed an uncertain effect of IVM (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.24; 1 study, 351 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Results remained similar when using the RR as the measure of effect. There were no data from any of the studies for cycle cancellation, oocyte fertilisation, or subgroup analyses. Authors' conclusions There is continuous scientific interest in IVM, and promising data have been published. Concerning live birth and clinical pregnancy, we are very uncertain about the effect of the technique when compared to IVF after using a GnRH antagonist protocol. In contrast, highÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence shows that IVM increases miscarriage per clinical pregnancy and reduces the incidence of moderate or severe OHSS in women with PCOS compared to IVF after a GnRH antagonist protocol. Regarding the rest of the outcomes, lowÃ¢â‚¬Â to moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence showed little to no difference in preterm birth and risk of congenital anomalies between the two modalities. We eagerly anticipate further evidence from highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality trials in the field (we found five ongoing trials). Plain language summary What is the best therapy for women who produce too many eggs when having fertility treatment? Key messages Ã¢â‚¬â€œ We do not know if in vitro maturation (growing immature eggs outside the body until they are mature enough for fertilisation) is better than in vitro fertilisation (treatment where eggs are fertilised with sperm in a laboratory) in increasing live births and pregnancies in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (where the ovaries do not produce eggs properly) who undergo fertility treatment. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ In vitro maturation increases miscarriage and reduces ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (painful condition where the ovaries produce too many eggs) in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome compared to in vitro fertilisation. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ There is little to no difference in premature births (before the due date) and the baby's development while in the womb, but more studies are needed. What is the problem? Women who have difficulty getting pregnant (reduced fertility) may need treatment to increase their chances of conceiving. This is where women take medication to stimulate egg growth, the eggs are removed and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory, and the fertilised egg is returned to the woman's womb. This is called in vitro fertilisation. Some women with reduced fertility have ovaries that do not produce eggs properly (called polycystic ovarian syndrome). If these women take medication to stimulate egg growth, they may produce too many eggs (called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome). This causes the ovaries to swell and become painful and may cause serious illness or (rarely) death. When women with polycystic ovarian syndrome take medications to stimulate their ovaries, the eggs produced are often too immature to be fertilised by sperm, leading to low pregnancy rates. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome may benefit from the earlier retrieval of eggs if the eggs are matured in the laboratory before they are fertilised (called in vitro maturation). While successful pregnancies have been reported, there is concern about the health of the babies born. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know if in vitro maturation is beneficial or harmful compared to in vitro fertilisation techniques in women with reduced fertility and polycystic ovarian syndrome. What did we do? We searched for studies investigating in vitro maturation and in vitro fertilisation techniques in women with reduced fertility and polycystic ovarian syndrome. We compared and summarised the results of these studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study method and size. We were interested in live births (delivery of a live baby after 20 weeks of pregnancy), miscarriage (loss of pregnancy during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy), clinical pregnancy (a fetal heartbeat on ultrasound scan at seven weeks of pregnancy), ovarian hyperstimulation, premature births, and the baby's development while in the womb. What did we find? We found four studies. Two provided insufficient data, but the other two published their results in full. These two studies involved 810 women. Main results Live birth rate was similar between in vitro maturation and in vitro fertilisation, but our confidence in the evidence is very low (2 studies, 739 women). If 45 women out of 100 have a live birth following in vitro fertilisation, the chance with in vitro maturation would be between 13 and 53 women out of 100. In vitro maturation increases miscarriage compared to in vitro fertilisation (2 studies, 378 women). If 20 women out of 100 have a miscarriage following in vitro fertilisation, the chance with in vitro maturation would be between 20 and 40 women out of 100. In vitro maturation results in a large reduction in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (2 studies, 739 women). If 4 women out of 100 have ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome with in vitro fertilisation, the chance with in vitro maturation would be between 0 and 2 women out of 100. There may be little to no difference in clinical pregnancy, but our confidence in the evidence is very low (2 studies, 739 women). In vitro maturation probably results in little to no difference in premature birth (2 studies, 739 women) and our confidence in the evidence is very low about the baby's health, development, or genetics while in the womb (1 study, 351 women). What are the limitations of the evidence? There is still uncertainty about the effect of in vitro maturation on live births and clinical pregnancies compared to in vitro fertilisation because the study methods differed and did not include enough women to provide meaningful results. We are confident that in vitro maturation increases the chance of miscarriage, and reduces the possibility of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. We are moderately confident in the evidence for premature birth due to the small number of women enrolled and have little confidence in the evidence for the baby's health, development, or genetics while in the womb due to the small number of women enrolled in only one study. These findings should be interpreted with caution. How up to date is the evidence? We reviewed the evidence up to February 2023.

J6241,2025,GonadotropinÃ¢â‚¬Âreleasing hormone agonist protocols for pituitary suppression in assisted reproduction,"- Background GonadotropinÃ¢â‚¬Âreleasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) are commonly used in assisted reproduction technology (ART) cycles to prevent a luteinising hormone (LH) surge during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) prior to planned oocyte retrieval, thus optimising the chances of live birth. We compared the benefits and risks of the different GnRHa protocols used. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of different GnRHa protocols used as adjuncts to COH in women undergoing ART. Search methods We searched the following databases in December 2022: the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and registries of ongoing trials. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and contacted experts in the field for any additional trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any two protocols of GnRHa, or variations of the protocol in terms of different doses or duration, used in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles in subfertile women. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. Our primary outcome measures were number of live births or ongoing pregnancies and incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per woman/couple randomised. Our secondary outcome measures included number of clinical pregnancies, pregnancy losses, number of oocytes retrieved, amount of gonadotropins used, and cost and acceptability of the treatment protocols. Main results We included 40 RCTs (4148 women). The trials evaluated 10 different comparisons between protocols. The evidence is current to December 2022. Only half of the studies reported the primary outcome of live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates. We restricted the primary analysis of live birth and ongoing pregnancy to trials with low risk of selection and reporting bias. Nineteen studies compared long and short protocols. The primary analysis restricted to trials with low risk of bias included five studies reporting on live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates. Results showed little or no difference when the long protocol was compared with a short protocol (odds ratio (OR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 2.52; IÃ‚Â² = 0%; 5 studies, 381 women; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). For the same comparison, there was evidence that the long protocol may improve clinical pregnancy rates when compared to the short protocol (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.40; IÃ‚Â² = 23%; 8 studies, 552 women; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). No study in this comparison reported on OHSS. We are uncertain if there is a difference between groups in terms of live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates when the following GnRHa protocols were compared: long versus ultrashort (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.72 to 4.36; 1 study, 150 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); long luteal versus long follicular phase (OR 1.89, 95% CI 0.87 to 4.10; 1 study, 223 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); GnRHa reducedÃ¢â‚¬Âdose versus GnRHa sameÃ¢â‚¬Âdose continued in the long protocol (OR 1.59, 95% CI 0.66 to 3.87; 1 study, 96 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); GnRHa administration for two versus three weeks before stimulation (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.05; 1 study, 85 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); GnRHa continued versus discontinued after human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) administration in the long protocol (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.64; 1 study, 181 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); and 500 Ã‚Âµg dose versus 80 Ã‚Âµg dose in the short protocol (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.98; 1 study, 200 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Clinical pregnancy rates may improve with a 100 Ã‚Âµg dose compared to a 25 Ã‚Âµg dose in the short protocol (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.06 to 5.00; 2 studies, 133 women; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Only four of the 40 included studies reported adverse events. We are uncertain of any difference in OHSS rate in the GnRHa reducedÃ¢â‚¬Âdose versus GnRHa sameÃ¢â‚¬Âdose regimen in the long protocol (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.04 to 5.35 1 study, 96 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) or when administration of GnRHa lasted for two versus three weeks before stimulation (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.37; 1 study, 85 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Regarding miscarriage rates, we are uncertain of any difference when the GnRHa long protocol was administered for two versus three weeks before stimulation (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.18 to 4.87; 1 study, 85 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and when a 500 Ã‚Âµg dose was compared with an 80 Ã‚Âµg dose in the short protocol (OR 3.15, 95% CI 0.32 to 31.05; 1 study, 131 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). No studies reported on costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness or acceptability of the different treatment protocols. The certainty of the evidence ranged from low to very low. The main limitations were failure to report live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates, poor reporting of methods in the primary studies, imprecise findings due to lack of data, and insufficient data regarding adverse events. Only eight of the 40 included studies were conducted within the last 10 years. Authors' conclusions When comparing long and short GnRHa protocols, we found little or no difference in live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates, but there was evidence that the long protocol may improve clinical pregnancy rates overall. We were uncertain of any difference in OHSS and miscarriage rates for all comparisons, which were reported by only two studies each. There was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions regarding other adverse effects or the costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness and acceptability of the different treatment protocols. Plain language summary Which hormone (GnRHa) medications work best with ovarian stimulation hormones in assisted conception cycles? Key messages Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ When comparing long versus short gonadotropinÃ¢â‚¬Âreleasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) treatment, there was little to no difference between groups for live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates, but the long treatment may result in a higher clinical pregnancy rate (where the foetus can be seen or heard). Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ We are uncertain if there is any difference in live birth and clinical pregnancy rates for the other comparisons studied, except for the comparison 100 Ã‚Âµg dose versus 25 Ã‚Âµg dose in a short treatment, which showed that clinical pregnancy may improve with a 100 Ã‚Âµg dose. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Further research is needed to look at the costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness and acceptability of the different treatments. What did we want to find out? GonadotropinÃ¢â‚¬Âreleasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) are given along with hormone injections that stimulate the ovaries to try to prevent the premature release of eggs before they can be harvested in a planned way by means of a surgical procedure. GnRHa have been shown to improve pregnancy rates. Various ways of giving GnRHa are described in the literature. We wanted to find out the most effective way of giving GnRHa to increase the number of babies born and ongoing pregnancy rates, in addition to reducing the rates of pregnancy loss and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (an unwanted effect of treatment with fertility medicines). What did we do? We reviewed the evidence on which medications (in the form of GnRHa) are best given together with hormones to stimulate ovaries for women trying to become pregnant through assisted conception. What did we find? We found 40 studies of 4148 women comparing the use of GnRHa in different ways during assisted conception treatment. Nineteen of these studies (1582 women) compared a long treatment (where GnRHa is started at least two weeks prior to hormone stimulation) with a short treatment (where GnRHa is started with the hormone stimulation). Main results When comparing long versus short GnRHa treatment, there was little to no difference between groups for live birth and ongoing pregnancy rates. Our findings suggest that in a population in which 14% of women achieve a live birth or ongoing pregnancy using a short treatment, between 12% and 30% will achieve this with a long treatment. There is evidence that the long treatment may result in a hig er clinical pregnancy rate (where the foetus can be seen or heard) when compared to the short treatment. Our findings suggest that, in a population where 16% of women will achieve a clinical pregnancy with the short treatment, 17% to 32% will achieve this with a long treatment. For other comparisons of GnRHa treatments, we are uncertain if there is any difference in terms of live birth and clinical pregnancy rate, except for the comparison of 100 Ã‚Âµg dose versus 25 Ã‚Âµg dose in a short treatment, which showed that clinical pregnancy may improve with a 100 Ã‚Âµg dose. We are uncertain if there is any difference in OHSS rates and pregnancy loss, which were reported by only two studies each. There was not enough evidence to reach any conclusions regarding other harmful effects. Further research is needed to look at the costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness and acceptability of the different treatments. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have low to very low confidence in the evidence. The main limitations in the evidence were nonÃ¢â‚¬Âreporting of live birth or ongoing pregnancy in half of the studies, poor reporting of study methods, unclear findings, very few studies reporting on unwanted effects such as OHSS, and lack of data regarding other harmful events, costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness, and acceptability of the treatments.

J6242,2025,Cost-effective and Green renal failure care - Hope or Reality : A proof of concept study,"Introduction: End-Stage Kidney disease (ESKD) has multi systems impact on patients and they require many interventions to manage their clinical state and maintain a reasonable quality of life. They warrant regular investigations to manage anaemia, metabolic state, fluid status and preserving a functioning dialysis access till they have renal transplantation. These interventions are intrusive, invasive and require repeated visits to their hospital and other clinical sites where the service provided. Remote measurement of the parameters will reduce the burden to patients and also the travel involved can reduce the impact of carbon emission to the local communities. The Alio SmartPatchTM represents a breakthrough in anaemia management in Chronic Kidney disease and it's a FDA- cleared device, the SmartPatch offers improvement over existing technologies by enabling real- time, non-invasive, and remote monitoring of multiple health parameters such as Heart rate, SaO2, Haemoglobin, Haematocrit, fluid status and the world's first non-invasive monitoring of abnormal potassium via a functioning AV access. In this study, we aims to evaluate the distance travelled between various sites needed to have their care for ESKD and assess the impact of using alio smartpatch and point of care ultrasound in reducing the travel need, thereby the impact on carbon emission. Method(s): The data was obtained from a prospective, open-labeled, non-randomized study performed to compare Haemoglobin, Haematocrit and Potassium results from the SmartPatch with the laboratory results during the same haemodialysis session. Adults with capacity to consent and receiving haemodialysis via an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG) in either upper limb were enrolled in this study. The SmartPatch was placed over the AV access site prior to the pre-dialysis blood draw. Skin color was classified using the Massey scale: light tones (1) to very dark tones (10). For this analysis, the pigmentation scale was divided into three categories: light (types 1-2), medium (types 3-5), and dark (types 5). The study was performed in United Kingdom, United States and Jordan. The distance travelled by the patient who participated in this study in single centre was measured and carbon emission calculation was performed using Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator. Result(s): A total of 21 patients from single UK site were selected for this analysis. There was consistent cost-savings was found in all study patients whom did self-care in the dialysis centre or required nursing or medical input to offer them appropriate care. The average travel distance for dialysis - 14.5 miles (three times a week) and we included for three unexpected visits / year. The calculation for annual Carbon footprint / Patient (Metric tons (MT) CO2) for Blood & Access latency visits is 0.08 and when combined with haemodialysis, it;s 0.62. For the study cohort, the blood & access review amounts to 1.68 MT and with HD, 13.02. The study centre dialyses 1100 patients and integrating remote monitoring device such as alio smartpatch will lead to 88MT and with HD -682 MT and to demonstrate the the impact, a flight from London to New York results in 6.2 MT. Conclusion(s): This proof of concept study demonstrates the impact of remote measurement of clinical parameters, Hb, Hct K+ and measuring latency of AV access using a alio smartpatch in the cost incurred by the care providers and notable reduction in the carbon emission. We aim to measure the impact from the other clinical sites and As CKD prevalence increases across the globe, these technologies will help the care providers to offer an effective and timely care to their patients.

J6244,2025,Pain management training for people with persistent pain and their informal carers (JOINT SUPPORT): Multicentre randomised controlled feasibility trial with embedded qualitative study in English musculoskeletal services,"Objectives To assess the feasibility of conducting a pragmatic, multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to test the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a pain management training intervention to support people with persistent musculoskeletal pain and their informal carers. Design Two-arm, multicentre, pragmatic, open, feasibility RCT with embedded qualitative study. Setting National Health Service (NHS) providers in four English hospitals. Participants Adults receiving NHS care for persistent musculoskeletal pain and their informal carers. Intervention Control: usual NHS care. Experimental: usual NHS care plus a carer-patient pain management training intervention (JOINT SUPPORT), comprising five, 1-hour, group-based sessions for patients and carers, delivered by trained physiotherapists or occupational therapists. Content included understanding pain, pacing, graded activity, fear avoidance, goal-setting, understanding the benefits of physical activity and medication management. This was re-enforced with a workbook. After the group-based sessions, patients and carers were supported through three telephone sessions. Randomisation Central randomisation was computer-generated (2:1 Experimental:Control), stratified by hospital and patient-participant age (<=65 years). There was no blinding. Main outcome measures Data collected at baseline and 3 months post-randomisation included screening logs, intervention logs, fidelity checklists and clinical outcomes on quality of life, physical and emotional outcomes, adverse events and resource use. Interviews with 14 patient-carer participants and six health professionals who delivered the intervention. Results A total of 76 participants (38 patients; 38 carers) were enrolled. Sixty per cent (312/480) of patients screened were eligible with 12% consenting to be randomised (38/312). Fifty-four per cent (13/24) of the experimental group reached minimal compliance with the JOINT SUPPORT intervention. There was no evidence of treatment contamination. For patient-participant outcomes, within-group differences from baseline to 3 months favoured the control group when assessed by EQ-5D and Generalised Self-Efficacy total score, but favoured the intervention group when assessed by numerical rating scale pain, fatigue and Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scaletotal score. Qualitative data demonstrated the acceptability of the trial design and JOINT SUPPORT intervention with modifications to improve trial processes. Conclusions The JOINT SUPPORT intervention was acceptable to patient-carer dyads and health professionals. Modifications to trial design, particularly enhanced recruitment strategies, are required.

J6256,2025,Identifying and Predicting Risk for Hospital Admission among Patients with Parkinsonism,"Background: Patients with parkinsonism are more likely than age-matched controls to be admitted to hospital. It may be possible to reduce the cost and negative impact by identifying patients at highest risk and intervening to reduce hospital-related costs. Predictive models have been developed in nonparkinsonism populations. Objective(s): The aims were to (1) describe the reasons for admission, (2) describe the rates of hospital admission/emergency department attendance over time, and (3) use routine data to risk stratify unplanned hospital attendance in people with parkinsonism. Method(s): This retrospective cohort study used Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD, a large UK primary care database, linked to hospital admission and emergency department attendance data. The primary diagnoses for nonelective admissions were categorized, and the frequencies were compared between parkinsonism cases and matched controls. Multilevel logistic and negative binomial regression models were used to estimate the risk of any and multiple admissions, respectively, for patients with parkinsonism. Result(s): There were 9189 patients with parkinsonism and 45,390 controls. The odds of emergency admission more than doubled from 2010 to 2019 (odds ratio [OR] 2.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.96, 2.76; P-value for trend <0.001). Pneumonia was the most common reason for admission among cases, followed by urinary tract infection. Increasing age, multimorbidity, parkinsonism duration, deprivation, and care home residence increased the odds of admission. Rural location was associated with reduced OR for admission (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.70, 0.89). Conclusion(s): Our risk stratification tool may enable empirical targeting of interventions to reduce admission risk for parkinsonism patients. Copyright Ã‚Â© 2024 The Author(s).

J6257,2025,Interventions to reduce nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial sales in community pharmacies,"- Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health concern. One of the most important causes of AMR is the excessive and inappropriate use of antimicrobial drugs in healthcare and community settings. Most countries have policies that require antimicrobial drugs to be obtained from a pharmacy by prescription. The term 'nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial sale' refers to the dispensing and selling of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription in countries where the pharmaceutical policy does not permit the sale of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription. Pharmacies, drugstores, and other medicine outlets are major sources of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial sales in the community setting. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for reducing nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial sales by pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists in community pharmacies, drugstores, and other medicine outlets. To assess whether the effects of interventions differ according to types of interventions (single or multicomponent), community pharmacy personnel (pharmacists or nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists), and countries (low to lowerÃ¢â‚¬ÂmiddleÃ¢â‚¬Âincome and upperÃ¢â‚¬Âmiddle to high income). Search methods We searched five databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, and two trial registers to 26 September 2022. We also conducted reference checking and citation searches. Selection criteria We included randomized trials, clusterÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized trials, and quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized trials evaluating interventions targeted at pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists in community pharmacies, drugstores, and other medicine outlets. Our primary outcomes were nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial sales, symptomatic or asymptomatic infections caused by antimicrobialÃ¢â‚¬Âresistant pathogens among pharmacy clients or community residents, and adverse events associated with nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial drug use in pharmacy clients. Our secondary outcomes were history taking and provision of advice to pharmacy clients, and knowledge of pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methods. Main results We included four trials conducted in pharmacies and drugstores. Three studies were published between 2000 and 2010, and the fourth in 2016. In total, 942 community pharmacies and drugstores participated, including both pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists. One study conducted in Scotland was a fourÃ¢â‚¬Âarm trial that included educational outreach visits, continuing professional education, and a combination of both as interventions, in comparison to a control group supplied with guideline materials only. Two studies conducted in Portugal and Uganda compared the combination of training and distribution of written materials with a control of no intervention. One study conducted in Thailand and Vietnam compared a sequence of three interventions (regulatory enforcement, education, and peerÃ¢â‚¬Âmonitoring) with a control of no intervention. Only nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial sales, history taking and provision of advice to pharmacy clients, and knowledge of pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists were assessed in the included studies; no study assessed other outcomes. We judged the overall risk of bias for nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial sales to be high risk and for the other two outcomes to be some concerns. One study conducted in Scotland assessed singleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent interventions (in two intervention arms) versus a control of written guidelines, and reported one primary outcome and one secondary outcome. NonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial sales: the study reported the sale or nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsale of antifungal drugs according to simulated patient scenarios. It did not report any differences between the intervention and control groups for the scenarios in which antifungal drugs should not have been sold without a prescription. The certainty of evidence for this outcome was very low. Knowledge of pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists: the study reported knowledge scores at baseline and followÃ¢â‚¬Âup, but did not compare the scores between t o singleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent intervention arms and the control arm at both time points. Four studies assessed multicomponent interventions versus a control of written guidelines or no intervention, and reported one primary outcome and two secondary outcomes. NonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial sales: two studies conducted in Uganda, Thailand, and Vietnam involving 337 randomized community pharmacies and drugstores reported the proportion of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial sales to the total number of requests using a simulated client method. Based on vote counting, both studies favored the intervention, that is multicomponent interventions reduced the sales of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial drugs by pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists. The information in the other two studies was inadequate to address this primary outcome. One study in Portugal reported that total antibiotic consumption at the municipal level (comprising both prescribed and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescribed antibiotic sales) was reduced after a multicomponent intervention. The study conducted in Scotland assessed a multicomponent intervention (in one intervention arm) and reported the sale or nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsale of antifungal drugs according to simulated patient scenarios. It did not report any differences between the intervention and control groups for the scenarios in which antifungal drugs should not have been sold without a prescription. The certainty of evidence for this outcome was very low. History taking and provision of advice to pharmacy clients: two studies conducted in Uganda, Thailand, and Vietnam reported this outcome. In Thailand and Vietnam, there was an improvement in the practices of pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists in the intervention groups, while Uganda reported a paradoxical decline. Knowledge of pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists: the study conducted in Scotland reported knowledge scores at baseline and followÃ¢â‚¬Âup, but did not compare the scores between the multicomponent intervention arm and control arm at both time points. Authors' conclusions No firm conclusions can be drawn about the effects of singleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent interventions due to limited evidence. Multicomponent interventions may not reduce the sales of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âprescription antimicrobial drugs in community pharmacies, drugstores, and other medicine outlets; however, the evidence is of very low certainty. Further studies on this topic are needed, particularly to assess the effects of important single interventions such as improving pharmaceutical policies. Plain language summary What are the effects of interventions on sales of antimicrobial drugs without prescription in community pharmacies? Key messages Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ There is no clear evidence that the singleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent interventions targeted at pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists in community pharmacies and drugstores are effective. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ When multicomponent interventions are used, the sale of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription may not be reduced, but we are very uncertain about the results. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ BetterÃ¢â‚¬Âquality studies are needed to fully look at this topic. What is antimicrobial resistance? Antimicrobial drugs kill microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. They can be grouped according to the microorganism they primarily act against; for example, antibiotics are used against bacteria, and antivirals are used against viruses. Antimicrobial resistance is the ability of microorganisms to persist or grow in the presence of these drugs. Many microorganisms become resistant to antimicrobial drugs due to the misuse and overuse of these drugs, especially in community settings. In many countries, antimicrobial drugs are recommended to be sold only with a doctorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prescription, but some pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists in community pharmacies and drugstores do sell them without a prescription. However, it is important to note that laws vary between countries. Antimicrobial drugs can be obtained without a prescription in some countries for certain circumstances. We need to know which interventions are effective in helping pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âp armacists reduce the sale of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription in countries where laws do not permit the sale of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription. What did we want to find out? In this review we looked at whether interventions that target pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists in community pharmacies and drugstores can reduce the sale of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription. What did we do? We searched for published studies in which researchers looked at the effect of educational training, government regulations, financial incentives, or peerÃ¢â‚¬Âmonitoring for reducing the sales of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription by pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our certainty in the evidence based on study methods and sizes. What did we find? We included four studies conducted in five countries: Portugal, Scotland, Thailand, Vietnam, and Uganda. The studies looked at three types of interventions at community pharmacies and drugstores: regulations on sales of antimicrobial drugs, education of pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists, and peerÃ¢â‚¬Âmonitoring on antimicrobial drug sales. When pharmacists and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âpharmacists in community pharmacies and drugstores received more than one intervention component, the number of sales of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription may not be reduced, but we are very uncertain about the results. No studies measured drugÃ¢â‚¬Âresistant infections or unwanted effects of antimicrobial drugs in pharmacy users. Further studies on this topic are needed, particularly looking at the effects of singleÃ¢â‚¬Âcomponent interventions. How upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate is this review?

J6261,2025,Physical rehabilitation approaches for the recovery of function and mobility following stroke,"- Background Various approaches to physical rehabilitation to improve function and mobility are used after stroke. There is considerable controversy around the relative effectiveness of approaches, and little known about optimal delivery and dose. Some physiotherapists base their treatments on a single approach; others use components from several different approaches. Objectives Primary objective: To determine whether physical rehabilitation is effective for recovery of function and mobility in people with stroke, and to assess if any one physical rehabilitation approach is more effective than any other approach. Secondary objective: To explore factors that may impact the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation approaches, including time after stroke, geographical location of study, intervention dose/duration, intervention provider, and treatment components. Stakeholder involvement: Key aims were to clarify the focus of the review, inform decisions about subgroup analyses, and coÃ¢â‚¬Âproduce statements relating to key implications. Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Stroke Trials Register (last searched November 2022), CENTRAL (2022, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2022), Embase (1980 to November 2022), AMED (1985 to November 2022), CINAHL (1982 to November 2022), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (to November 2022). Selection criteria Inclusion criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of physical rehabilitation approaches aimed at promoting the recovery of function or mobility in adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of stroke. Exclusion criteria : RCTs of upper limb function or single treatment components. Primary outcomes: measures of independence in activities of daily living (IADL) and motor function. Secondary outcomes: balance, gait velocity, and length of stay. Data collection and analysis Two independent authors selected studies according to preÃ¢â‚¬Âdefined eligibility criteria, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Main results In this review update, we included 267 studies (21,838 participants). Studies were conducted in 36 countries, with half (133/267) in China. Generally, studies were heterogeneous, and often poorly reported. We judged only 14 studies in metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalyses as at low risk of bias for all domains and, on average, we considered 33% of studies in analyses of primary outcomes at high risk of bias. Is physical rehabilitation more effective than no (or minimal) physical rehabilitation? Compared to no physical rehabilitation, physical rehabilitation may improve IADL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08 to 1.56; 52 studies, 5403 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and motor function (SMD 1.01, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22; 50 studies, 5669 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). There was evidence of longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm benefits for these outcomes. Physical rehabilitation may improve balance (MD 4.54, 95% CI 1.36 to 7.72; 9 studies, 452 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and likely improves gait velocity (SMD 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.42; 18 studies, 1131 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), but with no evidence of longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm benefits. Is physical rehabilitation more effective than attention control? The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of physical rehabilitation, as compared to attention control, on IADL (SMD 0.91, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.75; 2 studies, 106 participants), motor function (SMD 0.13, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.13 to 0.38; 5 studies, 237 participants), and balance (MD 6.61, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.45 to 13.66; 4 studies, 240 participants). Physical rehabilitation likely improves gait speed when compared to attention control (SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.54; 7 studies, 405 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Does additional physical rehabilitation improve outcomes? Additional physical rehabilitation may improve IADL (SMD 1.26, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.71; 21 studies, 1972 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and motor function (SMD 0.69, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.92; 22 studies, 1965 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Very few studies assessed these outcomes at longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. Additional physical rehabilitation may improve balance (MD 5.74, 95% CI 3.78 to 7.71; 15 studies, 795 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and gait velocity (SMD 0.59, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.91; 19 studies, 1004 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Very few studies assessed these outcomes at longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. Is any one approach to physical rehabilitation more effective than any other approach? Compared to other approaches, those that focus on functional task training may improve IADL (SMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.87; 22 studies, 1535 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and motor function (SMD 0.72, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.22; 20 studies, 1671 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) but the evidence in the latter is very uncertain. The benefit was sustained longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of functional task training on balance (MD 2.16, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.24 to 4.55) and gait velocity (SMD 0.28, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.01 to 0.56). Compared to other approaches, neurophysiological approaches may be less effective than other approaches in improving IADL (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.34, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.63 to Ã¢â‚¬Â0.06; 14 studies, 737 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), and there may be no difference in improving motor function (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.60, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â1.32 to 0.12; 13 studies, 663 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), balance (MD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.60, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â5.90 to 6.03; 9 studies, 292 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), and gait velocity (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.17, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.62 to 0.27; 16 studies, 630 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain about the effect on gait velocity. For all comparisons, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of physical rehabilitation on adverse events and length of hospital stay. Authors' conclusions Physical rehabilitation, using a mix of different treatment components, likely improves recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Additional physical rehabilitation, delivered as an adjunct to 'usual' rehabilitation, may provide added benefits. Physical rehabilitation approaches that focus on functional task training may be useful. Neurophysiological approaches to physical rehabilitation may be no different from, or less effective than, other physical rehabilitation approaches. Certainty in this evidence is limited due to substantial heterogeneity, with mainly small studies and important differences between study populations and interventions. We feel it is unlikely that any studies published since November 2022 would alter our conclusions. Given the size of this review, future updates warrant consensus discussion amongst stakeholders to ensure the most relevant questions are explored for optimal decisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking. Plain language summary How effective are different physical rehabilitation approaches in the recovery of function, balance, and walking after stroke? Key messages For people who have had a stroke: Ã¢â‚¬Â Physical rehabilitation may improve daily activities, moving legs, balance, and walking, when compared to no physical rehabilitation. There may be greater benefits when more than 2.5 hours/week of physical rehabilitation is delivered. Ã¢â‚¬Â Extra physical rehabilitation, given in addition to 'usual' physical rehabilitation, may also improve outcomes. The greater the amount of extra physical rehabilitation, the greater the benefit may be. Ã¢â‚¬Â Physical rehabilitation focussed on functional task training (the active practice of realÃ¢â‚¬Âlife tasks with the aim of acquiring Ã¢â‚¬Â or reacquiring Ã¢â‚¬Â a movement skill) may improve daily activities and movement. Why is it important to review the evidence on this topic? Stroke can cause paralysis of some parts of the body and can create difficulties with physical functions. Over the years, various approaches to physical rehabilitation have been developed, based on ideas about how people recover after a stroke. Often, physiotherapists will ch ose one particular approach, based on their clinical experience and the rationale, but clear research evidence is lacking. This means that techniques used by individual physiotherapists may differ (e.g. one may provide strengthening exercises, while another may focus on passive movements). Historically, a number of named physical rehabilitation approaches (e.g. the Ã¢â‚¬ËœBobathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ approach) have been used; together we call these neurophysiological approaches, as they were developed based on knowledge and theories relating to the function and recovery of the nervous system. It is important to help physiotherapists select the approach that will help their patients gain the best recovery. Note: Physiotherapist/physiotherapy can be called physical or rehabilitation therapist/therapy, meaning the same. We use the term physical rehabilitation and describe the person providing physical rehabilitation as a therapist. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know: Ã¢â‚¬Â Are physical rehabilitation approaches effective in the recovery of function and mobility in people with stroke? Ã¢â‚¬Â Is one physical rehabilitation approach more effective than another approach? What did we do? We searched for relevant studies, called randomised controlled trials. We brought together studies in which people who had a stroke received physical rehabilitation with the goal of improving the ability to walk and carry out activities of daily living. We were interested in different approaches to physical rehabilitation (i.e. a programme of treatment based on a particular scientific rationale). These approaches might involve therapistÃ¢â‚¬Âdelivered, group, or remote treatment. Therapists may select specific treatments/exercises according to individual patient needs, or deliver standard exercises based on the stage of patient recovery. We excluded studies that only looked at 'single' treatments (e.g. electrical stimulation, robotic device) or were focused only on arm function. What did we find? We found 267 studies, which included 21,838 people with stroke. Studies were from 36 different countries, but half (133 studies) were carried out in China. One hundred and five studies looked at whether physical rehabilitation was better than no physical rehabilitation. Most of these studies were carried out in hospital inÃ¢â‚¬Âpatient settings in China where physical rehabilitation was not part of routine care, but a few were carried out in outpatient settings after the patient had been discharged from routine physical rehabilitation. These studies showed that physical rehabilitation may improve a person's ability to carry out activities of daily living, move the legs, remain balanced, and walk, in comparison to no physical rehabilitation. FiftyÃ¢â‚¬Âsix studies looked at the effect of giving extra, or additional, physical rehabilitation. Everyone in these studies received their usual physical rehabilitation, but one group of stroke survivors received some additional treatment based on a particular physical rehabilitation approach. These studies showed that additional physical rehabilitation may improve the ability to carry out activities of daily living, move the legs, remain balanced, and walk; the greater the amount of additional rehabilitation, the greater the possible benefit. NinetyÃ¢â‚¬Âtwo studies compared different physical rehabilitation approaches. There were many variations in the types and amount of physical rehabilitation, and the types of people (e.g. different lengths of time postÃ¢â‚¬Âstroke). These studies showed that physical rehabilitation that focused on functional task training may improve the ability to carry out activities of daily living and move the legs (but not balance or walking). Neurophysiological approaches to physical rehabilitation may be less effective than other approaches at improving daily activities (but no different for other outcomes). For all comparisons, there was very limited information about potential adverse events relating to physical rehabilitation. Few studies took longÃ¢â‚¬Âterm followÃ¢â‚¬Âup measurements after the physical rehabil tation had stopped. What are the limitations of the evidence? There were large variations between participants, interventions, outcomes, and comparisons in the studies included in this review. There were also geographical and cultural differences that may influence the results. Generally, the reporting of the details of these studies was very poor. These issues mean that we have limited confidence in the results of our statistical analyses. How upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate is this evidence? The evidence is upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate to November 2022.

J6263,2025,"QbTest for ADHD assessment and medication management: A mixed-methods systematic review of impact on clinical outcomes and patient, carer and clinician experiences","Objectives To explore patient, carer and clinician experiences of the QbTest and its impact on patient outcomes for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis and medication management. Design Mixed-methods systematic review. Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP (from inception to September 2024). Study selection Primary studies, of any design, that evaluated any version of the QbTest (QbMini <5 years, QbTest 6-12 or 12-60 years, QbCheck for remote assessment via webcam or QbMT smartphone version), for ADHD diagnosis and/or medication management and provided data on any of the following outcomes, were eligible: time to assessment/diagnostic decision, use of services, impact on clinical decision-making, healthcare professionals' confidence in assessment, intervention use, morbidity, mortality, health-related quality of life, cost, ease of use, experience and acceptability of the test to patients, carers and clinicians. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed potentially relevant reports for inclusion. One reviewer conducted data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment, checked by a second reviewer. Mixed-methods synthesis followed the convergent-integrated approach. Results We identified 10 eligible studies (9 QbTest; 1 QbCheck), including 1 randomised controlled trial (RCT), 2 feasibility RCTs, 5 before-And-After studies, 1 mixed-methods study and 1 diagnostic study. Most studies enrolled children in the UK and included surveys or interviews with patients, carers or clinicians. The RCT and before-And-After studies were judged at high/serious RoB. Six survey components and two qualitative interview components were judged at some concerns of RoB. We identified one ongoing study of the QbMT and no studies for QbMini. We organised themes emerging from the qualitative synthesis into two broad conceptual categories: views around the helpfulness of the QbTest (contribution to ADHD diagnosis, treatment decision-making, communication with caregivers) and barriers to QbTest implementation (practical barriers and acceptability of the test to patients and caregivers). Findings suggested that the addition of the QbTest may reduce time to diagnosis, improve clinician confidence in the diagnostic decision, increase the proportion of patients with a diagnostic decision and reduce cost and number of clinic appointments. The QbTest appeared to be generally well received by clinicians, patients and carers. However, barriers to test implementation were reported. Clinicians cited staffing, room requirements and issues with technology, and patients highlighted the test length and repetitive nature. Little data exist on the use of the QbTest for medication management. Conclusions The available evidence suggests the QbTest may be a useful addition to ADHD assessment in children and young people. Further well-designed RCTs with qualitative substudies are required to assess the impact of the QbTest on patient outcomes, user experience and cost, particularly for medication management and in adults, where evidence is scarce. Such RCTs should include economic analyses, direct comparisons to other continuous performance tests with motion trackers and subgroup analyses including age, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities.

J6264,2025,"The Post Op: Delivering the final mile of ERAS in Surgery""","Objectives: In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) provides free medical care to all legal UK residents, spending approximately 10% of its GDP on health. Given the substantial costs associated with hospital visits and inpatient stays, optimizing patient access to healthcare services and managing patient flow is critical. This study presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of a digital postoperative care pathway, focusing on the introduction of the 'Post Op' app, which connects post-surgery patients with their clinical teams for remote follow-up. This innovation aims to address the final mile"" of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathway. Method(s): The 'Post Op' app was piloted at a district general hospital, with patients encouraged to use the app for up to 60 days post-surgery. Data were collected through telephone surveys and anonymized questionnaires. Feedback indicated that over 70% of patients felt the app prevented unnecessary healthcare visits, primarily due to the reassurance provided. This finding aligns with qualitative studies suggesting improved patient satisfaction and fewer complications post op, although the direct financial impact had not been quantified prior to this study.Our cost-effectiveness analysis simulated populations with varying levels of postop anxiety and complications. The analysis considered costs associated with avoidable presentations to the Emergency Department (ED), environmental costs, and costs related to antibiotic tolerance and resistance due to late recognition of surgical site infections (SSIs). Result(s): The results demonstrated significant potential savings for NHS resources, estimating that a digitalized postoperative care pathway could save over 60,000 per 100 patients, even accounting for an increased number of outpatient follow-up visits. Key findings include the reduction of inappropriate medical care-seeking episodes, prevention of postoperative complication deterioration, mitigation of environmental costs linked to excessive hospital resource use and patient transport, and alleviation of costs borne by patients. Specifically, savings from avoided ED visits ranged from 22,225 to 43,435 per 100 patients, with additional savings from early detection of SSIs and prevention of antibiotic resistance estimated at 27,909 per 100 patients. Conclusion(s): The study concludes that the 'Post Op' app provides excellent support for postop patients, significantly reducing the number of unnecessary contacts with GPs, hospitals, and EDs. This results in substantial cost savings for both the NHS and patients. Additionally, the early recognition and treatment of SSIs through the app further enhance cost savings, highlighting the app's role in optimizing the final mile of the ERAS pathway. The digital postoperative follow-up tool not only improves patient outcomes but demonstrates a promising approach to healthcare delivery, aligning with the goals of cost efficiency, improving patient care within the NHS.

J6267,2025,Experiences of support to return to work after stroke: longitudinal case studies from RETAKE trial,"Background: Returning to work after stroke has physical, psychological and financial benefits for stroke survivors. However, global evidence estimates return-to-work rates 1 year post stroke at < 50%. Although its importance is acknowledged by policy-makers and healthcare providers, vocational rehabilitation is not always part of National Health Service usual care post stroke. Currently, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of return-to-work support interventions. RETurn to work After stroKE was a multicentre individually randomised controlled pragmatic trial, with embedded process and health economic evaluations. RETurn to work After stroKE aimed to establish whether Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation plus usual care improves the likelihood of return to work at 12 months post stroke compared to usual care alone. As part of an embedded process evaluation, longitudinal case studies enabled exploration of participants' experiences of support to return to work in the trial. Objective(s): This article aims to understand participants' experiences of being supported to return to work and explores the social and structural factors which support, or act as barriers to, implementation of the Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation intervention. Method(s): A longitudinal case-study approach was used to compare experiences of post-stroke return-to-work support received over 12 months by 15 participants who received the Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation intervention plus usual care, and 11 participants who received usual care only. Data were gathered at three time points using follow-up questionnaires, health records, intervention delivery records and semistructured interviews with participants and seven nominated informal carers. Interviews were also conducted with 1 employer and 11 occupational therapists delivering the intervention. Setting(s): Sixteen National Health Service sites across England and Wales. Finding(s): In the intervention arm, stroke survivors, carers and employers reported benefits from information and support from the treating occupational therapist to facilitate acceptance of, and adaptation to, post-stroke abilities. Participants also valued occupational therapists' provision of sustained and tailored vocational rehabilitation, co-ordinating their care and advocating for them in return-to-work discussions with their employers. Those unable to return to their previous employment were supported to consider alternative options. In contrast, participants who received usual care only reported feeling abandoned when community rehabilitation support ended, typically after 2-8 weeks. Usual care largely focused on restoring physical function, leaving these participants struggling to find return-to-work information, advice and support. Longitudinal case studies enabled psychosocial and environmental factors impacting on participants' return-to-work experiences to be considered. Limitation(s): Recruitment to the process evaluation was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It proved difficult to recruit employers for interview, and fewer women participated in the case studies (21 men, 5 women). Direct observation of intervention delivery could not be carried out as planned due to pandemic restrictions on access to clinical areas. Conclusion(s): These case studies highlighted self-reported differences between recipients of the Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation intervention plus usual care and participants allocated to usual care only. Aspects perceived as important in underpinning the differences in support included the length of Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation intervention, occupational therapist advocacy, employer liaison and ongoing workplace monitoring. Provision of these core components as part of post-stroke services may support and help to sustain return to work, with associated benefits for stroke survivors and wider society.

J6268,2025,Cost-effectiveness of a group psychological intervention for postnatal depression in British south Asian women: an economic evaluation from the ROSHNI-2 trial,"Background: Minority ethnic groups often face ethnocultural barriers in accessing mental health treatments. The ROSHNI-2 trial compared culturally adapted cognitive behavioural therapy (Positive Health Programme [PHP]) with treatment as usual for postnatal depression in British south Asian women. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the PHP intervention. Method(s): The ROSHNI-2 trial was a multicentre, two-arm, assessor-blinded, randomised controlled trial; we conducted an economic evaluation over a 12-month period to assess the cost-effectiveness of PHP plus treatment as usual versus treatment as usual alone from the perspective of the English National Health Service and personal social services. In the trial, British south Asian women aged 16 years or older with a child aged up to 12 months, and meeting DSM-5 criteria for depression, were recruited from northwest England, Yorkshire, the East Midlands, and London. The PHP intervention involved 12 group sessions delivered by two trained bilingual facilitators, held once per week for 2 months and once per fortnight thereafter, each lasting 60-90 min. Questionnaires on depression symptoms, quality of life, and resource use were completed at baseline, 4 months (end of intervention), and 12 months after random assignment. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were used for the cost-utility analysis, and recovery from depression at 4 months (the primary clinical outcome), assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, informed the cost-effectiveness analysis. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the intervention was adapted for online delivery for the remaining participants. A stratified analysis compared the cost-effectiveness of online versus in-person delivery. The trial involved researchers with lived experience, and all methods, including health economic measures, were developed in consultation with service users, community members, and faith leaders. This is a preplanned analysis of the ROSHNI-2 trial, registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN10697380). Finding(s): From Feb 8, 2017, to March 29, 2020, 732 eligible women were enrolled: 368 participants were randomly assigned to the PHP arm and 364 to the treatment as usual arm. The base-case intention-to-treat analysis showed that PHP significantly increased costs (712, 95% CI 311 to 1113) and QALYs (0.036, 95% CI 0.006 to 0.067), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 19 601 (7622 to 83 772). Based on the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) maximum willingness-to-pay threshold of 30 000 per QALY, the likelihood of PHP being cost-effective was 77% from a health and social care perspective. Cost per remission from depression at the 4-month follow-up was 5509 (2916 to 17 860). In a stratified analysis of 34 participants attending online sessions during the pandemic, incremental QALY effects were 0.125 (0.048 to 0.203), resulting in costs of 202 (-3906 to 10 918) per additional QALY gained. Interpretation(s): The average cost of PHP for postpartum women was below the lower end of the NICE threshold of 20 000-30 000 per QALY, excluding benefits to the child or potential gains such as reduced lost productivity from early remission. PHP, a culturally adapted group cognitive behavioural therapy-based intervention, might be a cost-effective intervention for postnatal depression in British south Asian women. Online PHP delivery showed promising clinical and cost-effective results for this group but requires a large-scale study. Funding(s): UK National Institute for Health and Care Research.

J6272,2025,PostÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing for people with schizophrenia after coercive measures,"- Background Schizophrenia and schizophreniaÃ¢â‚¬Âtype psychosis, severe mental illnesses globally impacting millions, present a dual challenge with their characteristic positive and negative symptoms, economic burdens, and heightened susceptibility to coercive measures. These measures, including seclusion and restraint, raise ethical concerns despite their intent to ensure safety, particularly during acute stages marked by violent behaviour. Addressing this backdrop, the significance of postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing as an intervention to curtail the use and duration of coercive measures and alleviate the negative psychological effects of using these methods in managing individuals with schizophrenia is underscored. The employment of coercive measures, such as physical restraint and seclusion, to manage aggressive behaviour in psychiatric settings necessitates a thorough examination of their ethical implications and potential psychological harm. Although postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing is recommended, the limited evidence supporting its efficacy and concerns about its impact on psychological wellÃ¢â‚¬Âbeing prompt a comprehensive analysis of existing literature. Objectives To investigate the effects of postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing after coercive measures for people with schizophrenia or schizophreniaÃ¢â‚¬Âtype psychosis. Search methods The Information Specialist conducted searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Specialised Register (compiled from searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, ISRCTN, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses A&I) on 28 February 2023. We also inspected the references of all identified studies. Selection criteria We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing after coercive measures in adult psychiatric care with participants diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizophreniaÃ¢â‚¬Âtype psychosis, encompassing various clinical states and stages. We considered studies if the postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing was the only intervention randomised. Data collection and analysis At least two authors inspected the citations, selected studies, extracted data and conducted quality appraisal. We calculated a standard estimation of the risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for binary outcomes and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We assessed study risk of bias and used the GRADE approach to create a summary of findings table. Main results We included one study; the total number of participants randomised was 422, of which 109 participated. Participants were between 18 and 65 years old with psychotic disorder, at the acute stage of their illness, and had experienced at least one coercive measure during their hospital stay. The study included a standardised postÃ¢â‚¬Âcoercion review that was conducted until the discharge of the participant. For the primary outcome, we found that there may be an increased risk of being secluded again for those receiving postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing compared to treatment as usual, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.74 to 2.33; 1 study, 109 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). No evidence was found that postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing had an effect in reducing peritraumatic distress (MD Ã¢â‚¬Â1.62, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â7.47 to 4.23; 1 study, 82 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) or increasing satisfaction with care (perceived coercion: MD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.37, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â1.59 to 0.85; 1 study, 109 participants; coercion experience: MD Ã¢â‚¬Â1.61, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â13.36 to 10.14; 1 study, 109 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) compared to treatment as usual. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing on these outcomes. No usable data were available for change in patient behaviour or adverse effects. Authors' conclusions Considering the available evidence, it is not possible to arrive at definitive conclusions that postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing after coercive measures is effective for people with schizophrenia or schizophreniaÃ¢â‚¬Âtype psychosis. F rther highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing in psychiatric inpatient care. Plain language summary Is postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing after coercive measures for people with schizophrenia effective? Key messages Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Due to a lack of evidence, the benefits of postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing after coercive measures (seclusion: locking someone in a separate room, or restraint: preventing them from moving) for people with schizophrenia or schizophreniaÃ¢â‚¬Âtype psychosis are unclear. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Future research is needed into the effects of postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing after coercive measures to find out whether it has benefits for people with schizophrenia and whether it has unwanted effects and costs. What is schizophrenia, and what are seclusion and restraint? Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition that affects how people think, feel and behave. Schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders significantly impact millions of people globally, and pose challenges due to their diverse symptoms, economic burden and the risk of a person being locked in a secure room (seclusion) or prevented from moving (restraint), particularly if their behaviour is violent. PostÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing is suggested as a way to reduce the use and duration of these measures, and aims to ensure safety while acknowledging the ethical concerns and potential psychological harm that such measures may cause. Seclusion is a coercive measure, which means locking a person into a separate room in a psychiatric ward. Restraint means preventing a person from moving, manually by staff members, or with different equipment, such as belts. These measures should be used as a last resort to prevent a person from hurting themselves or others. PostÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing can be used after these coercive measures and is a form of talking therapy. It aims to allow staff and people who have experienced coercion to learn from the event and so prevent future episodes of coercion. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing after coercive measures for people with schizophrenia or schizophreniaÃ¢â‚¬Âtype psychosis. What did we do? We carried out a comprehensive search in specialised databases to identify studies in which people with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to two or more treatment groups to assess postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing in adult psychiatric care. What did we find? We found one relevant study with data for 109 people. This study involved standardised postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing until the person left hospital. People who received postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing after coercive measures may be more likely to be secluded again compared to those receiving standard treatment, but this is very uncertain. The evidence supporting this result is based on one study, and we have very limited confidence in this finding. There was no evidence to suggest that people are less distressed during or immediately after the event or that they are more satisfied with their care compared to standard treatment. Again, we have very limited confidence in this finding. There was not enough information to determine changes in patient behaviour or unwanted or harmful effects. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have very little confidence in these findings because we only found one small study, and there were problems with how it was designed and reported. Although postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing is common practice in clinical settings, the evidence is currently not available to support it in current forms. The findings of this review therefore suggest caution in its use. The review highlights the need for further highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality studies to thoroughly assess the effects of postÃ¢â‚¬Âincident debriefing in psychiatric inpatient care. Any postÃ¢â‚¬Âincidence debriefing measures should be clearly defined and described so that people know how and why to use them in daily practice. How up to date is this evidence?

J6273,2025,AnkleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthoses for improving walking in adults with calf muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disorders,"- Background Calf muscle weakness is a common symptom in slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders that lead to walking problems like instability and increased walking effort. The mainstay of treatment to improve walking in this population is the provision of ankleÃ¢â‚¬ÂfootÃ¢â‚¬Âorthoses (AFOs). Since we are not aware of an upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate and complete overview of the effects of AFOs used for calf muscle weakness in slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders, we reviewed the evidence for the effectiveness of AFOs to improve walking in this patient group, in order to support clinical decisionÃ¢â‚¬Âmaking. Objectives To review the evidence for the effects of ankleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthoses (AFOs) for improving walking in adults with calf muscle weakness due to slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders. Search methods On 10 February 2023, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, Embase, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. Selection criteria We looked for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including randomised crossÃ¢â‚¬Âover studies and quasiÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCTs, and nonÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomised studies (NRSs) that examined the effects of AFO interventions compared with shoesÃ¢â‚¬Âonly walking in adults with calf muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disorders. Data collection and analysis We used the methodological procedures described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . We summarised findings for the primary outcome (objectively measured walking effort, assessed as walking energy cost) and secondary outcomes (perceived walking effort, physical mobility, gait parameters, AFO use, satisfaction with the AFO, and adverse events). We grouped results according to the type of AFO material and synthesised them in metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis where possible. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included four randomised crossÃ¢â‚¬Âover studies and six NRSs with 186 participants in total (the smallest study had 8 participants and the largest had 37). All studies were designed as selfÃ¢â‚¬Âcontrolled studies and examined the effects of customÃ¢â‚¬Âmade and/or prefabricated AFOs. The AFOs were made of carbon (5 studies), polypropylene (5 studies), silicone (1 study), metal (1 study), elastic materials (2 studies), or leather combined with other materials (1 study). Outcome measures with AFOs were assessed during a single session (in some studies, people already used the study AFO in daily life), when the AFO was delivered, or at threeÃ¢â‚¬Âweek or threeÃ¢â‚¬Âmonth followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. We judged one study to be at moderate risk of bias, and nine studies to be at high or serious risk of bias, primarily due to bias arising from period and carryover effects, selection bias, the inability to blind participants and assessors, missing data, and selective reporting. We found that carbon AFOs may reduce walking energy cost (mean difference (MD) Ã¢Ë†â€™0.86 J/kg/m, 95% confidence interval (CI) Ã¢Ë†â€™1.33 to Ã¢Ë†â€™0.39; 2 studies, 45 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), and may increase walking speed (MD 0.19 m/s, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.27; 4 studies, 71 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) compared to shoesÃ¢â‚¬Âonly walking. We found that leather AFOs may increase walking speed (MD 0.25 m/s, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.43; 1 study, 11 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Little or no effect on walking speed was found with polypropylene AFOs (MD 0.00 m/s, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™0.11 to 0.11; 2 studies, 25 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and elastic AFOs (MD 0.03 m/s, 95% CI Ã¢Ë†â€™0.12 to 0.18; 1 study, 14 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Carbon AFOs may also enhance satisfaction while walking (1 study, 16 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). We were unable to draw conclusions about perceived walking effort (one study, 8 participants), balance (two studies, 21 participants), and AFO use (two studies, 51 participants), as the evidence is very uncertain. Finally, two studies (45 participants) reported on adverse events (lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions The available evidence for ankleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthoses AFOs) to improve walking in adults with calf muscle weakness comes from a limited number of small studies with heterogeneity in intervention characteristics and outcome assessment, and is of low to very low certainty. The evidence suggests that carbon AFOs may reduce walking energy cost (effort), increase walking speed, and enhance satisfaction, and leather AFOs may increase walking speed, while polypropylene and elastic AFOs may make little or no difference to walking speed. We are unable to draw conclusions about the effects of AFOs on perceived walking effort, balance, and use. Nor can we draw conclusions about adverse effects of using AFOs. The variety in the findings for AFOs made of different materials suggests further investigation is warranted to explore how different AFO materials impact walking improvement in people with calf muscle weakness due to slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders. Plain language summary AnkleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthoses to improve walking in people with weakness of the calf muscles due to neuromuscular disorders Key messages AnkleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthoses (AFOs) may reduce the effort required to walk, and increase walking speed and satisfaction with walking in people with calf muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disorders, but we are uncertain about these results. We are unable to draw any conclusions about the effect of AFOs on perceived walking effort, balance, AFO use, and adverse effects. The evidence suggests effects on walking improvement may vary depending on the material from which the AFO is made. Future studies could explore this further. Why is this question important? Many neuromuscular disorders, i.e. disorders of the muscles or the nerves that control the muscles, cause weakness of the calf muscles. As the calf muscles are essential for safe and efficient walking, weakness of these muscles will lead to major changes in how people walk. Calf muscle weakness makes walking less stable and walking requires more energy. This leads to problems such as falls and tiredness. What did we want to find out? AnkleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthoses are devices that can be provided to improve walking in people with neuromuscular disorders. There are many different types of ankleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthoses and their effects on walking vary considerably. To help healthcare professionals and patients make informed decisions about the use of ankleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthoses, we wanted to review the available evidence about their effects on walking. What did we do? We searched the medical literature for all relevant studies that compared walking with ankleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthoses to walking only with shoes. We then compared the results, summarised the evidence, and assessed our confidence in the evidence. To do this, we considered the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. What did we find? We found 10 relevant studies with 186 participants in total. Overall, the results suggest that the use of ankleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthoses made from carbon may reduce walking effort (measured objectively), increase walking speed, and enhance satisfaction while walking. Leather AFOs may increase walking speed. We are unable to draw conclusions about perceived walking effort and balance with AFOs compared to shoes, and about the use of AFOs, as the evidence is very uncertain. We are unable to draw conclusions about adverse events due to AFO interventions in comparison with no intervention. The certainty of all evidence for the effects found was either very low or low. What does this mean? Currently, the evidence for using ankleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthoses to improve walking in people with calf muscle weakness is limited. Large prospective studies of high quality are needed to address this knowledge gap. The variety in the effects found for AFOs of different materials warrants further investigation. Future studies could examine the effect of AFO material on the improvement of walking in people with calf muscle weakness due to slowly progressive neuromuscular disorders. What are the limitations of the evidence? Four of the included studies that as essed the effects of AFOs had a randomised crossÃ¢â‚¬Âover design; the other six studies were not randomised. Outcomes were assessed at different time points, and most studies did not include followÃ¢â‚¬Âup assessments. The ankleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthosis types that were examined varied in their design and material. Most ankleÃ¢â‚¬ÂfootÃ¢â‚¬Âorthosis types, in particular the ankleÃ¢â‚¬Âfoot orthoses that were made of carbon, were customÃ¢â‚¬Âmade; the remainder were prefabricated. These factors reduced our confidence in the evidence. How up to date is this review?

J6275,2025,A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing single-inhaler extrafine beclomethasone/formoterol/glycopyrronium bromide against other SITTs in adult patients with uncontrolled asthma in England,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: In patients with asthma uncontrolled by a medium or high-strength (MS/HS) inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA), according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, a maintenance therapy option is the addition of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) via single-inhaler triple therapy (SITT). Evidence has previously been published on the cost-effectiveness of a SITT extra fine formulation of beclomethasone, formoterol and glycopyrronium bromide (BDP/FOR/GLY) vs. dual ICS/LABA combination, using data from two 52-week clinical trials (TRIMARAN and TRIGGER). However, there is limited evidence on the comparative cost-effectiveness of SITTs. The current analysis evaluated the cost-effectiveness of BDP/FOR/GLY versus other SITTs, in the UK setting.
<b>METHODS</b>: Markov cohort state-transition model was developed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of BDP/FOR/GLY Medium Strength (MS) vs. fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) MS and, BDP/FOR/GLY High Strength vs. FF/UMEC/VI HS and vs. indacaterol acetate, glycopyrronium bromide, and mometasone (IND/GLY/MF) HS. A network meta-analysis was performed to estimate comparative efficacy of BDP/FOR/GLY against other SITTs. The model analyzed cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), net monetary benefit (NMB), and was developed from the perspective of England National Health Service (NHS) and Prescribed Specialized Services expenditure (2022 costs). Uncertainty of the inputs was estimated using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
<b>RESULTS</b>: BDP/FOR/GLY MS was projected to be a dominant treatment alternative against FF/UMEC/VI MS (5,121 less costly, gained 0.065 additional QALYs). Similarly, BDP/FOR/GLY HS was a dominant treatment alternative against FF/UMEC/VI HS (143, 0.003 additional QALYs) and IND/GLY/MF HS (692 less costly, gained 0.023 additional QALYs). BDP/FOR/GLY MS and HS had 77.1%, 51.3%, and 61.2% likelihoods to be cost-effective vs. FF/UMEC/VI MS, FF/UMEC/VI HS, and IND/GLY/MF HS at the defined willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 20,000 per QALY gained, respectively.

J6276,2025,Cardiovascular training for fatigue in people with cancer,"- Rationale CancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue (CRF) is the most prevalent and severe symptom among people with cancer. It can be attributed to the cancer itself or to anticancer therapies. CRF affects the individual physically and mentally, and cannot be alleviated by rest. Studies show a positive effect of exercise on CRF. Objectives To evaluate the effects of cardiovascular training on cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue (CRF), quality of life (QoL), adverse events, anxiety, and depression in people with cancer, with regard to their stage of anticancer therapy (before, during, or after), up to 12 weeks, up to six months, or longer, postintervention. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization ICTRP to identify studies that are included in the review. The latest search date was October 2023. Eligibility criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating cardiovascular training for CRF or QoL, or both, in people with cancer. Trials were eligible if training was structured, included at least five sessions, and instruction was faceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âface (via video tools or in person). We excluded studies with fewer than 20 randomised participants per group and where only an abstract was available. Outcomes Our critical outcomes were: shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â, mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â, longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm CRF and QoL. Important outcomes were adverse events, and shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â, mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â, longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm anxiety and depression. Risk of bias We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess bias in RCTs. Synthesis methods We used standard Cochrane methodology. We synthesised results for each outcome using metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis where possible (inverse variance or MantelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHaenszel; randomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffects model). We pooled data for the respective assessment periods above. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. Included studies We included 23 RCTs with 2135 participants, of whom 96.6% originated from highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âincome countries; 1101 participants were randomised to cardiovascular training and 1034 to no training. Studies included mostly females who were diagnosed with breast cancer. We also identified 36 ongoing and 12 completed studies that have not yet published (awaiting assessment). We only present findings on CRF, QoL and adverse events. For details regarding anxiety and depression, see full text. Synthesis of results Cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy versus no training for people with cancer We identified no studies for inclusion in this comparison. Cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy versus no training for people with cancer We included 10 studies (1026 participants); eight studies contributed data to quantitative analyses (860 participants). Cardiovascular training probably reduces shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm CRF slightly (mean difference (MD) 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16 to 4.55, on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Fatigue (FACTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂF), scale 0 to 52, higher values mean better outcome; minimally important difference (MID) 3; 6 studies, 593 participants) and probably results in little to no difference in shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm QoL (MD 3.56, 95% CI 0.21 to 6.90, on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ CÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â30), scale 0 to 100, higher values mean better outcome, MID 10; 6 studies, 612 participants) (both moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effects on mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm CRF (MD 2.67, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢2.58 to 7.92, on FACTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂF; MID 3; 1 study, 62 participants), longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm CRF (MD 0.41, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢2.24 to 3.05, on FACTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂF; MID 3; 2 studies, 230 participants), mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm QoL (MD 6.79, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢4.39 to 17.97, on EORTC QLQ CÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â30; MID 10; 1 study, 62 participants), and longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm QoL (MD 1.51, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢3.40 to 6.42, on EORTC QLQ CÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â30; MID 10; 2 studies, 230 participants) (all very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). For adverse events (any grade and followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup), we did not perform metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis due to heterogeneous definitions, reporting, and measurement (9 RCTs, 955 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬ certainty evidence). Cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy versus no training for people with cancer We included 13 studies (1109 participants); nine studies contributed data to quantitative analyses (756 participants). We are uncertain about the effects of cardiovascular training on shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm CRF (MD 3.62, 95% CI 0 to 7.13, on FACTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂF; MID 3; 6 studies, 497 participants), longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm CRF (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢0.80, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢1.72 to 0.13, on the Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), scale 1 to 10, higher values mean worse outcome; MID 1; 2 studies, 262 participants), shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm QoL (MD 3.70, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢0.14 to 7.41, on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ General (FACTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂG), scale 0 to 108, higher values mean better outcome; MID 4; 8 studies, 642 participants), longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm QoL (MD 3.10, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢1.12 to 7.32, on FACTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂG; MID 4; 1 study, 201 participants), and adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 2.71, 95% CI 0.58 to 12.67; 1 study, 50 participants) (all very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). There were no data for mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm CRF and QoL . Authors' conclusions ModerateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence shows that cardiovascular training by people with cancer during their anticancer therapy slightly reduces shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm CRF and results in little to no difference in shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm QoL . We do not know whether cardiovascular training increases or decreases mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm CRF/QoL , and longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm CRF/QoL . There is very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence (due to heterogeneous definitions, reporting and measurement) evaluating whether the training increases or decreases adverse events . In people with cancer who perform cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy, we are uncertain about the effects on shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm CRF/QoL , longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm CRF/QoL , and adverse events . We identified a lack of evidence concerning cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy and on safety outcomes. The 36 ongoing and 12 completed, but unpublished, studies could help close this gap, and could contribute to improving the effect estimates and certainty.

Plain language summary Does cardiovascular training relieve cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue before, during, or after anticancer therapy? Key messages Cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy probably reduces cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue slightly for up to 12 weeks. The longerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm effects of cardiovascular training on cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue and quality of life are uncertain and there is no evidence about the effects of cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy. We found nearly 50 studies of cardiovascular training before, during, and after cancer treatment that are underway and these will add to the evidence when the results are published. What is cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue? CancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue is an extreme feeling of tiredness over a long period of time. It can be caused by cancer treatment or the cancer itself. It is the most common symptom among people with cancer. It cannot be relieved by rest, and it affects the body and mind. What is cardiovascular training? Cardiovascular training is any activity that uses the large muscle groups of the buttocks and thighs, and increases heart and breathing rate. Examples are walking, running, cycling, and swimming. Why is cardiovascular training possibly effective for cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue? CancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue is linked to the body's response to cytokines, which regulate how tissues and organs increase in size (called cell growth). Cancer or cancer therapy may produce proteins called proÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âinflammatory cytokines, which cause or worsen inflammation (the body's response to an injury or illness, which includes symptoms such as swelling and pain). Cardiovascular training can help reduce inflammation. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether cardiovascular training reduces cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue compared to no training. We ex lored the effects at short (up to 12 weeks), medium (up to six months), and long term (longer than six months). We also looked at quality of life, unwanted effects, anxiety, and depression. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated cardiovascular training before, during, or after anticancer therapy compared to no training. These studies needed to evaluate cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue or quality of life, or both. The cardiovascular training had to have at least five sessions of exercise and had to be given by faceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âface instruction (either by video or in person). We did not consider studies with fewer than 20 people per group, or that were available in a short summary form only. What did we find? We found 23 studies with 2135 people. Most studies were conducted in highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âincome countries (97%; where people have easy access to goodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality health care). A total of 1101 people received cardiovascular training and 1034 people received no training. The people included in the studies were mostly female and had breast cancer. We also found 36 ongoing studies, and 12 completed studies that have yet to be published. Main results There were no studies comparing cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy to no training. We included 10 studies for cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy, but could only use the results of eight. For cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy versus no training, we found 13 studies for inclusion, but could only use the results of nine. Cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy versus no training: probably reduces shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue slightly (6 studies, 593 people); probably results in little to no difference in shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm quality of life (6 studies, 612 people); we do not know if cardiovascular training increases or decreases mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue and quality of life , and any unwanted effects. Cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy versus no training: we do not know if cardiovascular training increases or decreases shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue and quality of life , and any unwanted effects; we could not find any data for mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue and quality of life. What are the limitations of the evidence? We are moderately confident in the evidence about the effect of cardiovascular training during anticancer therapy on shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue and quality of life . Our confidence in the other evidence is very low as there were fewer or smaller studies, and people knew which treatment they received. There was no evidence for cardiovascular training before anticancer therapy and for cardiovascular training after anticancer therapy on mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated fatigue and quality of life .

J6278,2025,Cost effectiveness of different treatment strategies with natalizumab for pregnant women with multiple sclerosis,"Background: The management of multiple sclerosis (MS) during pregnancy poses significant challenges. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of three natalizumab treatment strategies during pregnancy from the UK healthcare system's perspective. Method(s): A Markov model was developed to assess the health outcomes and costs associated with three treatment strategies: continuous natalizumab treatment throughout pregnancy, treatment until the first trimester followed by discontinuation, and discontinuation at conception with resumption post-pregnancy. The model incorporated data on relapse rates, disability progression, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted. Result(s): Continuing natalizumab throughout pregnancy was the most cost-effective strategy, yielding the highest incremental QALY gains and the lowest incremental cost per QALY (1713 per QALY), with a net monetary benefit of 743. The sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings and the use of generic or biosimilar forms of natalizumab further reinforced the cost-effectiveness of continuous treatment, with the biosimilar option proving cost-saving. Conclusion(s): Continuing natalizumab treatment throughout pregnancy is the most cost-effective approach for managing MS in pregnant women. These findings should inform clinical guidelines and support healthcare providers and women with MS planning their family in making evidence-based decisions to improve the management of MS during pregnancy.

J6279,2025,A personalized and systematically designed adherence intervention improves photoprotection in adults with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP): results of the XPAND randomized controlled trial,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: Poor adherence to photoprotection in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) increases morbidity and shortens lifespan due to skin cancers.
<b>OBJECTIVES</b>: To test a highly personalized intervention (XPAND) to reduce the dose of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the face in adults with XP, designed using known psychosocial determinants of poor photoprotection.
<b>METHODS</b>: A two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial, including patients with suboptimal photoprotection to receive XPAND or a delayed-intervention control arm that received XPAND the following year. XPAND comprises seven 1 : 1 sessions targeting photoprotection barriers (e.g. misconceptions about UVR) supported by personalized text messages, activity sheets and educational materials incorporating behaviour change techniques. The primary outcome, mean daily UVR dose to face across 21 days in June-July 2018, was calculated by combining UVR exposure at the wrist with a face photoprotection activity diary. Secondary outcomes were UVR dose to face across 21 days in August 2018, time spent outside, photoprotective measures used outside, mood, automaticity and confidence to photoprotect. Financial costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated.
<b>RESULTS</b>: Sixteen patients were randomized; 13 provided sufficient data for primary outcome analysis. The XPAND group (n = 8) had lower mean daily UVR dose to face [0.03 standard error of difference (SED) (SD 0.02)] compared with controls (n = 7) [0.43 SED (SD 0.17)] (adjusted difference = -0.25, P < 0.001, Hedge's g = 2.21) at the June 2018 assessment. No significant between-group differences were observed in time spent outside, photoprotection outside, mood or confidence. The delayed-intervention control showed improvements in UVR dose to face (adjusted difference = -0.05; Hedge's g = -0.1), time outside (adjusted difference = -69.9; Hedge's g = -0.28) and photoprotection (adjusted difference = -0.23, Hedge's g = 0.45) after receiving XPAND (June 2019 assessment). XPAND was associated with lower treatment costs [-2642; 95% confidence interval (CI) -8715 to 3873] and fewer QALYs (-0.0141; 95% CI -0.0369 to 0.0028).

J6280,2025,Effectiveness of biomarker-guided duration of antibiotic treatment in children hospitalised with confirmed or suspected bacterial infection: the BATCH RCT,"<b>Background</b>: Procalcitonin is a biomarker specific for bacterial infection, with a more rapid response than other commonly used biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein, but it is not routinely used in the National Health Service.
<b>Objective</b>: To determine if using a procalcitonin-guided algorithm may safely reduce duration of antibiotic therapy compared to standard of care in hospitalised children with suspected or confirmed infection.
<b>Design</b>: A pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, parallel two-arm, individually randomised controlled trial with internal pilot phase, qualitative study and health economic evaluations.
<b>Setting</b>: Paediatric wards or paediatric intensive care units within children's hospitals (n = 6) and district general hospitals (n = 9) in the United Kingdom.
<b>Participants</b>: Children aged between 72 hours and 18 years admitted to hospital and being treated with intravenous antibiotics for suspected or confirmed bacterial infection.
<b>Interventions</b>: Procalcitonin-guided algorithm versus usual standard care alone.
<b>Main outcome measures</b>: Coprimary outcomes were duration of intravenous antibiotic use and a composite safety measure.
<b>Results</b>: Between 11 June 2018 and 12 October 2022, 1949 children were recruited: 977 to the procalcitonin group [427 female (43.7%), 550 male (56.3%)], and 972 to the usual care group [478 female (49.2%), 494 male (50.8%)]. Duration of intravenous antibiotics was not significantly different between the procalcitonin group (median 96.0 hours) and the usual care group (median 99.7 hours) [hazard ratio = 0.96 (0.87, 1.05)], and the procalcitonin-guided algorithm was non-inferior to usual care [risk difference = -0.81% (95% confidence interval upper bound 1.11%)]. At clinical review, a procalcitonin result was available for 81.8% of the time, which was considered as part of clinical decision-making 66.6% of the time, and the algorithm was adhered to 57.2% of the time. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per duration of intravenous antibiotics hour avoided from bootstrapped samples was 467.62 per intravenous antibiotic hour avoided. Cost analysis of complete cases was also higher in the procalcitonin arm for all age groups, and for children aged 5 years and over. The intervention is not cost-effective as it is more expensive with no significant improvement in intravenous antibiotic duration.
<b>Limitations</b>: Robust antimicrobial stewardship programmes were already implemented in the lead recruiting sites, and adherence to the algorithm was poor. Clinicians may be reluctant to adhere to biomarker-guided algorithms, due to unfamiliarity with interpreting the test result.
<b>Conclusions</b>: In children hospitalised with confirmed or suspected bacterial infection, the addition of a procalcitonin-guided algorithm to usual care is non-inferior in terms of safety, but does not reduce duration of intravenous antibiotics, and is not cost-effective. In the presence of robust antimicrobial stewardship programmes to reduce antibiotic use, a procalcitonin-guided algorithm may offer little added value.
<b>Future work</b>: Future trials must include an implementation framework to improve trial intervention fidelity, and repeated cycles of education and training to facilitate implementation of biomarker-guided algorithms into routine clinical care.

J6281,2025,"Clinical and cost-effectiveness of a home-based health promotion intervention for older people with mild frailty in England: a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial","Background: Health promotion for people with mild frailty has the potential to improve health outcomes, but such services are scarce in practice. We developed a personalised, home-based, behaviour change, health promotion intervention (HomeHealth) and assessed its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in maintaining independent functioning in activities of daily living in older adults with mild frailty. Method(s): This trial was an individual, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial done in England. Participants were mainly recruited from general practices in three different areas of England (the London north Thames region, east and north Hertfordshire, and west Yorkshire). Participants were individuals residing in the community who were registered with a general practice, 65 years and older with mild frailty (scoring 5 on the CFS), with a life expectancy of more than 6 months, and with capacity to consent to participate. We excluded adults residing in nursing or care homes, those with moderate-to-severe frailty or with no frailty, those receiving palliative care, and those already case managed (eg, receiving a similar ongoing intervention from the voluntary sector or community service). Eligible participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to either the HomeHealth intervention or to treatment as usual. HomeHealth is a multidomain health promotion intervention delivered by the voluntary sector at home in six sessions over 6 months. The primary outcome was independent functioning (assessed using the modified Barthel Index [BI]) at 12 months. Outcome assessments were masked and were analysed by intention to treat using linear mixed models. Incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using seemingly unrelated regression and bootstrapping. The trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN54268283). Finding(s): We recruited 388 participants between Jan 8, 2021 and July 2, 2022 (mean age 81 years, SD 6.5; 249 (64%) of 388 were women and 139 (36%) were men). 195 participants were randomly assigned to HomeHealth and 193 to treatment as usual. Median follow-up was 363 days (IQR 356-370) in the HomeHealth group and 362 days (IQR 355-373) in the treatment-as-usual group. HomeHealth did not improve BI scores at 12 months (mean difference 0.250, 95% CI -0.932 to 1.432). HomeHealth was superior to treatment as usual with a negative point estimate for incremental costs (-796; 95% CI -2016 to 424) and positive point estimate for incremental QALYs (0.009, -0.021 to 0.039). There were 55 serious adverse events in the HomeHealth group and 85 in the treatment-as-usual group; none were intervention related. Interpretation(s): HomeHealth is a safe intervention with a high probability of cost-effectiveness, driven by a reduction in unplanned hospital admissions. HomeHealth should be considered as a health promotion intervention for older people with mild frailty. Funding(s): National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment.

J6282,2025,Impact and cost-effectiveness of scaling up HCV testing and treatment strategies for achieving HCV elimination among people who inject drugs in England: a mathematical modelling study,"Background: England aims to reach the World Health Organization (WHO) elimination target of decreasing HCV incidence among people who inject drugs (PWID) to <2 per 100 person-years (/100pyrs) by 2030. We assessed what testing and treatment strategies will achieve this target and whether they are cost-effective. Method(s): A dynamic deterministic HCV transmission model among PWID was developed for four England regions, utilising data on the scale-up of HCV treatment among PWID in prisons, drug treatment centres (DTC, where opioid agonist therapy is provided), and any other setting (e.g., primary care). The model projected whether the elimination target will be reached with existing testing and treatment initiatives ('status quo' model, SQ), or whether improvements are needed from 2024. Cost data was collated through practitioners' interviews and published literature. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER per quality adjusted life year (QALY) saved, 50-year time horizon; 3.5% discount rate) of SQ (assumes counterfactual of no treatment scale-up post-2015) and improved model (counterfactual: SQ model) was compared to a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000/QALY saved. Finding(s): The SQ model projects HCV incidence will decrease by 79.7-98.6% (range of medians) over 2015-2030 to 0.2-2.2/100pyrs, with an ICER of 308-1609/QALY saved across the regions. There is >80% probability of achieving the incidence target in three regions, and 40% probability in the other region. If annual testing in DTC increases to 80% (from 27%) or 75% of people get tested during their prison stay (from 55%) from 2024 in the lower impact region, then their probability increases to >65%, with both strategies being highly cost-effective. Interpretation(s): Many England regions could reach the WHO HCV elimination target by 2030 under existing testing and treatment pathways. Scaling up of testing in DTC or prisons will help achieve this target and is highly cost-effective. Funding(s): NIHR.

J6284,2025,Gonadotropins for ovulation induction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome,"- Rationale Ovulation induction with follicleÃ¢â‚¬Âstimulating hormone (FSH) is a secondÃ¢â‚¬Âline treatment in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who do not ovulate or conceive on clomiphene citrate or letrozole, though induction protocols and types of gonadotropins used vary greatly. Objectives To compare the effectiveness and safety of gonadotropins as a secondÃ¢â‚¬Âline treatment for ovulation induction in women with PCOS who do not ovulate or conceive after clomiphene citrate or letrozole. Search methods In March 2024, we searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO. We checked references of all relevant studies. We had no language or date restrictions. Eligibility criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reporting data on clinical outcomes in women with PCOS who did not ovulate or conceive on clomiphene citrate or letrozole, and were undergoing ovulation induction with urinaryÃ¢â‚¬Âderived gonadotropins, including urofollitropin in purified FSH (uFSH) or highly purified FSH (HPÃ¢â‚¬ÂFSH) form, human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) and highly purified human menopausal gonadotropin (HPÃ¢â‚¬ÂHMG), or recombinant FSH (rFSH) were eligible. We included trials reporting on ovulation induction followed by intercourse or intrauterine insemination. We excluded studies that described coÃ¢â‚¬Âtreatment with clomiphene citrate, metformin, luteinising hormone, or letrozole. Outcomes We implemented the core outcome set for infertility. Our critical outcomes were live birth rate and multiple pregnancy rate per woman. Important outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy loss, incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per woman, total gonadotropin dose, total duration of stimulation per woman, gestational age at birth, birthweight, neonatal mortality, and major congenital anomaly. Risk of bias We used the Cochrane RoB 1 tool to assess bias in the included studies. Synthesis methods Where metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis was possible, we combined data using a fixedÃ¢â‚¬Âeffect model to calculate the risk ratio (RR) or mean difference. We summarised the overall certainty of evidence for the main outcomes using GRADE criteria. Included studies We included 15 studies with 2348 women. Ten trials compared rFSH with urinaryÃ¢â‚¬Âderived gonadotropins (one compared rFSH with human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG), and nine compared rFSH with urinary FSH). Three trials compared HMG with purified FSH (uFSH). One trial compared HPÃ¢â‚¬ÂFSH with purified FSH (uFSH) and one trial compared gonadotropins with continued clomiphene citrate. Synthesis of results Recombinant FSH (rFSH) versus urinaryÃ¢â‚¬Âderived gonadotropins There may be little or no difference in the birth rate between rFSH and urinaryÃ¢â‚¬Âderived gonadotropins (RR 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.78; 5 RCTs, 505 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). This suggests that if the observed average live birth per woman who used urinaryÃ¢â‚¬Âderived gonadotropins is 16%, the chance of live birth with rFSH is between 13% and 28%. There may be little or no difference between groups in multiple pregnancy (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.61; 8 RCTs, 1368 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.27; 8 RCTs, 1330 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), or miscarriage rate (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.71 to 2.04; 7 RCTs, 970 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). We are uncertain whether rFSH reduces ectopic pregnancy (RR 2.81, 95% CI 0.12 to 67.90; 1 RCT, 151 participants; veryÃ¢â‚¬Âlow certainty evidence) or the incidence of OHSS (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.65; 10 RCTs, 1565 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) when compared to urinaryÃ¢â‚¬Âderived gonadotropins. Human menopausal gonadotropin (HMG) versus purified urinary FSH (uFSH) When compared to uFSH, we are uncertain whether HMG improves live birth rate (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.76; 2 RCTs, 79 participants), or reduces multiple pregnancy (RR 6.56, 95% CI 0.28 to 152.45; 3 RCTs, 102 participants). We are also u certain whether HMG improves clinical pregnancy rate (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.59; 3 RCTs, 102 participants), reduces miscarriage rate (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.97; 2 RCTs, 98 participants), or reduces the incidence of OHSS (RR 7.07, 95% CI 0.42 to 117.81; 2 RCTs, 53 participants) when compared to uFSH. No trials reported on ectopic pregnancy. The certainty of the evidence was very low for all outcomes. Gonadotropins versus continued clomiphene citrate Gonadotropins (FSH) probably result in more live births than continued clomiphene citrate (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.46; 1 RCT, 661 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). This suggests that for a woman with a live birth rate of 41% with continued clomiphene citrate, the live birth rate with gonadotropins was between 43% and 60%. There may be little or no difference in multiple pregnancy between treatments (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.44; 1 RCT, 661 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Gonadotropins probably result in more clinical pregnancies than continued clomiphene citrate (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.52; 1 RCT, 661 participants; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), and may result in more miscarriages (RR 2.23, 95% CI 1.11 to 4.47; 1 RCT, 661 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). We are uncertain if there is a difference in ectopic pregnancy between the groups (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.77; 1 RCT, 661 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). None of the women developed OHSS. The main limitations were imprecision, inconsistency, and indirectness. Authors' conclusions There may be little or no difference in live birth, multiple pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, or miscarriage rates between rFSH and uFSH in women with PCOS. For HMG versus uFSH, we are uncertain whether one or the other improves or lowers rates of live birth, multiple pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, or miscarriage. We are uncertain whether any of the interventions reduce ectopic pregnancy or the incidence of OHSS. In women with clomiphene citrate failure, gonadotropins (FSH) probably result in more live births and clinical pregnancies than continued clomiphene citrate without increasing multiple pregnancies. Gonadotropins may increase the miscarriage rate per woman. We are uncertain if gonadotropins reduce ectopic pregnancy. None of the women developed OHSS.

For human menopausal gonadotropin (also derived from the urine of menopausal women) versus purified urinary follicle stimulating hormone, we are uncertain whether one or the other improves or reduces the chance of a live birth, multiple pregnancy, pregnancy, or miscarriage. In women who do not conceive after taking clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins probably result in more live births and pregnancies compared to continuing treatment with clomiphene citrate, without increasing the risk of having twins or triplets. Gonadotropins may increase the risk of a miscarriage. What is the problem? One in seven couples worldwide may experience infertility, defined as having trouble getting pregnant after one year of trying. Infertility due to problems with the release of an egg (ovulation) during the menstrual cycle is the most common reason for women to seek counselling or treatment. These women are treated by stimulating the release of an egg from the ovaries with medication, soÃ¢â‚¬Âcalled 'ovulation induction'. This is usuall done with pills containing clomiphene citrate, as the first choice of treatment. If women do not respond to clomiphene, the most common second choice of treatment is stimulation of egg release with gonadotropins, which are injectable drugs. What are the available treatments? Various types of gonadotropins have been developed by processing urine from menopausal women. These gonadotropins include human menopausal gonadotropin, available in purified and highly purified form, and purified and highly purified follicleÃ¢â‚¬Âstimulating hormone. Finally, recombinant follicleÃ¢â‚¬Âstimulating hormone was developed artificially to obtain even higher purity. Women who do ovulate, but do not get pregnant within six cycles of treatment with clomiphene citrate, may continue with clomiphene citrate or switch to gonadotropins. Gonadotropins can result in the development of multiple follicles. To prevent multiple pregnancy and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which is a serious condition, the cycle needs to be cancelled. It is important to know which medication works best to enable doctors and women to make informed decisions about the course of treatment. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out which gonadotropin is the best choice to trigger egg release in women with PCOS who do not ovulate or get pregnant after taking clomiphene citrate pills. What did we do? We searched for studies comparing different gonadotropins to stimulate ovulation in women with PCOS. We summarised the results of the included studies and rated our confidence in the evidence by evaluating factors such as study methods and study size. What did we find? The review includes 15 studies with 2348 women with PCOS. Ten trials compared recombinant FSH with urinaryÃ¢â‚¬Âderived gonadotropins. Three trials compared human menopausal gonadotropin with purified urinary follicleÃ¢â‚¬Âstimulating hormone and one trial compared gonadotropins with continued clomiphene citrate. Main results There may be little or no difference in live birth, multiple pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, or miscarriage rate between purified urinaryÃ¢â‚¬Âderived gonadotropins and recombinant follicleÃ¢â‚¬Âstimulating hormone. We are uncertain whether human menopausal gonadotropin improves pregnancy outcomes in women with PCOS compared to urinary follicleÃ¢â‚¬Âstimulating hormone. We are uncertain whether any of the treatments reduce the risk of OHSS or ectopic pregnancy. When compared to continued treatment with clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins probably result in more live births and pregnancies without increasing the rate of multiple pregnancies. Gonadotropins may result in more miscarriages than clomiphene citrate, while there were no cases of OHSS. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. Many studies had small sample sizes and were conducted a long time ago, meaning important information about study methods was missing. Ten of the 15 studies included in this review reported a commercial sponsor.

J6288,2025,Stem cell injections for osteoarthritis of the knee,"- Background Stem cells are specialised precursor cells that can replace aged or damaged cells and thereby maintain healthy tissue function. Stem cell therapy is increasingly used as a treatment for knee osteoarthritis, despite the lack of clarity around the mechanism by which stem cell therapy may slow down disease progression in osteoarthritis, and uncertainty regarding its benefits and harms. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of stem cell injections for people with osteoarthritis of the knee. A secondary objective is to maintain the currency of the evidence, using a living systematic review approach. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase on 15 September 2023, unrestricted by date or language of publication. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for relevant trial protocols and ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), or trials using quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomised methods of participant allocation, comparing stem cell injection with placebo injection, no treatment or usual care, glucocorticoid injection, other injections, exercise, drug therapy, surgical interventions, and supplements and complementary therapies in people with knee osteoarthritis. Data collection and analysis Two review authors selected studies for inclusion, extracted trial characteristics and outcome data, assessed risk of bias and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. The primary comparison was stem cell injection compared with placebo injection. The primary time point for pain, function and quality of life was three to six months, and the end of the trial period for participantÃ¢â‚¬Âreported success, joint structure changes and adverse event outcomes. Major outcomes were pain, function, quality of life, global assessment of success, radiographic joint progression, withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events. Main results We found 25 randomised trials (1341 participants) comparing stem cell injections with placebo injection (eight trials), no treatment or usual care (analgesia, weight loss and exercise) (two trials), glucocorticoid injection (one trial), hyaluronic acid injection (seven trials), plateletÃ¢â‚¬Ârich plasma injections (two trials), oral acetaminophen (paracetamol) (one trial), nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsteroidal antiÃ¢â‚¬Âinflammatory drugs plus physical therapy plus hyaluronic acid injection (one trial) and stem cell injection plus intraÃ¢â‚¬Âarticular coÃ¢â‚¬Âintervention versus coÃ¢â‚¬Âintervention alone (three trials) in people with osteoarthritis of the knee. Trials were predominantly small, with sample sizes ranging from 6 to 252 participants, with only two trials having more than 100 participants. The average age of participants across trials ranged from 51 to 66 years, and symptom duration varied from one to 10 years. PlaceboÃ¢â‚¬Âcontrolled trials were largely free from bias, while most trials without a placebo control were susceptible to performance and detection biases. Here, we limit reporting to the main comparison, stem cell injection versus placebo injection. Compared with placebo injection, stem cell injection may slightly improve pain and function up to six months after treatment. Mean pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) was 4.5 out of 10 points with placebo injection and 1.2 points better (2.5 points better to 0 points better) with stem cell injection (I 2 = 80%; 7 studies, 445 participants). Mean function (0 to 100 scale, 0 best function) was 46.3 points with placebo injection and 14.2 points better (25.3 points better to 3.1 points better) with stem cell injection (I 2 = 82%; 7 studies, 432 participants). We are uncertain whether stem cell injections improve quality of life or increase the number of people who report treatment success compared to placebo injection, because the certainty of the evidence was very low. Mean quality of life was 45.3 points with placebo injection and 22.8 points better (18.0 points worse to 63.7 point better) with stem cell injection (I 2 = 96%; 2 studies, 288 participants) at up to six months followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. At the end of followÃ¢â‚¬Âup, 89/168 participants (530 per 1000) in the placebo injection group reported treatment success compared with 126/180 participants (683 per 1000) in the stem cell injection group (risk ratio (RR) 1.29, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.53; I 2 = 0%; 4 trials, 348 participants). We downgraded the evidence to low certainty for pain and function due to indirectness (as the source, method of preparation and dose of stem cells varied across studies), and suspected publication bias (up to three larger RCTs have been conducted but withdrawn prior to reporting of results). For quality of life and treatment success, we further downgraded the evidence to very low certainty due to imprecision in addition to indirectness and suspected publication bias. We are uncertain of the potential harms associated with stem cell injection, as there were very low event rates for serious adverse events. At the end of followÃ¢â‚¬Âup, 5/219 participants (23 per 1000) in the placebo injection group experienced serious adverse events compared with 4/242 participants (16 per 1000) in the stem cell injection group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.64; I 2 = 0%; 7 trials, 461 participants) and there were no reported withdrawals due to adverse events. We downgraded the evidence to very low certainty due to indirectness, suspected publication bias and imprecision. Radiographic progression was not assessed in any of the included studies. Authors' conclusions Compared with placebo injections and based upon lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, stem cell injections for people with knee osteoarthritis may slightly improve pain and function. We are uncertain of the effects of stem cell injections on quality of life or the number who report treatment success. Although the putative benefits of stem cell therapies for osteoarthritis include potential regenerative effects on damaged tissues, particularly articular cartilage, we remain uncertain of the effect of stem cell injections on structural progression in the knee (measured by radiographic appearance). There is also uncertainty regarding the safety of stem cell injections. Serious adverse events were infrequently reported, although all invasive joint procedures (including injections) carry a small risk of septic arthritis. The risk of other important harms, including potential concerns related to the use of a therapy with the theoretical capacity to promote cell growth, or to the use of allogeneic cells, remains unknown. Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of stem cell injections for knee osteoarthritis? Key messages Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Compared with placebo injection, stem cell injection for people with knee osteoarthritis may slightly improve pain and function. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ We are uncertain whether stem cell injection slows down the progression of the disease, improves quality of life or the chance of treatment success, or whether stem cell injections are safe. What is osteoarthritis? Osteoarthritis is a disease of the joints. The joint loses cartilage and other changes to the structure of the joint may occur. This can lead to pain and reduced ability to use the joint. How is osteoarthritis treated? Most treatments aim to relieve symptoms, although few are effective. Joint replacement surgery is the only definitive treatment, and is reserved for people with severe disease who have not experienced any benefit from other treatments. Stem cells are a special type of cell that can develop into mature cells in different parts of the body, including cells that produce cartilage, bone and fat tissue. Thus, in theory, these stem cells could lead to regrowth of damaged cartilage in the joint, which has led to their use as a treatment for osteoarthritis. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if stem cell injections improve pain, function, treatment success and quality of life, slow down disease progression or lead to harm in people with knee osteoarthritis. What did we do? We searched for studies that investigated tem cell injection compared with placebo, no treatment or usual (routine) care, or other treatments in knee osteoarthritis. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as variability in the stem cell injections, completeness of the evidence and study size. What did we find? We found 25 studies (1341 participants), including 8 studies (459 participants) that compared stem cell injection into the knee with a placebo injection. The remaining studies compared stem cell injection with no treatment or usual care (2 studies, 30 participants), intraÃ¢â‚¬Âarticular glucocorticoid injection (1 study, 33 participants), hyaluronic acid injection (7 studies, 429 participants), plateletÃ¢â‚¬Ârich plasma injection (2 studies, 142 participants), oral acetaminophen (paracetamol; 1 study, 51 participants), NSAIDs (nonÃ¢â‚¬Âsteroidal antiÃ¢â‚¬Âinflammatory drugs) plus physical therapy plus hyaluronic acid injection (1 study, 57 participants) and stem cell injection plus intraÃ¢â‚¬Âarticular coÃ¢â‚¬Âintervention versus coÃ¢â‚¬Âintervention alone (3 studies, 140 participants). Studies were conducted worldwide, including Europe, the Middle East, Asia, the USA, South America, the United Kingdom and Australia. Main results Compared with placebo injections, stem cell injections may improve pain and function slightly. Pain measured on a 0 to 10 scale (0 is no pain) at six months was 1.2 points better with stem cell injection. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ People who had stem cell injection rated their pain as 3.3 points. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ People who had placebo injection rated their pain as 4.5 points. Function measured on a 0 to 100 scale (0 is best function) at six months was 14.2 points better with stem cell injection. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ People who had stem cell injection rated their function as 32.1 points. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ People who had placebo injection rated their function as 46.3 points. Quality of life measured on a 0 to 100 scale (0 is best function) at six months was 22.8 points better with stem cell injection. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ People who had stem cell injection rated their quality of life as 68.1 points. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ People who had placebo injection rated their quality of life as 45.3 points. After stem cell injection, 153 more people per 1000 rated their treatment a success at 12 months. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ 683 per 1000 reported treatment success with stem cell injection. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ 530 per 1000 reported treatment success with placebo injection. After stem cell injection, seven fewer people per 1000 had serious adverse events at 12 months. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ 16 per 1000 people experienced a serious adverse event with stem cell injection. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ 23 per 1000 people reported a serious adverse event with placebo injection. No withdrawals from the study due to harms from stem cell or placebo injections were reported. Disease progression was not assessed in any study. What are the limitations of the evidence? Our confidence in the estimates for pain and function is low, as the optimal preparation and dose of stem cells is unknown, and varied across studies. Further, up to three larger studies could not be included, as they were conducted but withdrawn by their investigators before reporting results. We are uncertain whether more people report treatment success, or improvement in quality of life. We are uncertain of the risk of serious harms and harms leading to treatment discontinuation because, in addition to the variation in stem cells used across studies and missing results from larger studies, there were a very small number of events. How upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate is this evidence? The evidence is upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate to 15 September 2023. Editorial note: This is a living systematic review.

J6290,2025,Transfusion of blood and blood products for the management of postpartum haemorrhage,"- Rationale Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is commonly defined as blood loss of 500 mL or greater within 24 hours after birth. Intravenous transfusions of whole blood, red blood cells (RBC), or other blood components collected from a donor may be administered to manage PPH. Key questions remain regarding optimal timing for initiating blood and blood product transfusion in managing PPH and whether the use of fractionated blood products, either as replacement for or in addition to whole blood transfusion, could improve maternal outcomes. No systematic review has examined appropriate transfusion strategies for managing PPH. Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of transfusion of whole blood or other blood products for preventing morbidity and mortality among women with PPH. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors to identify studies for inclusion in the review. The latest search was 18 July 2024. Eligibility criteria We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), clusterÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomised trials, or controlled nonÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomised studies of interventions (NRSI) evaluating the efficacy and safety of blood transfusion for managing PPH, regardless of the mode of birth. Outcomes Our critical outcomes were maternal death, severe maternal morbidity, and adverse effects. Risk of bias We assessed risk of bias in included studies using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and the Risk Of Bias In NonÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINSÃ¢â‚¬ÂI) tool. Synthesis methods We synthesised results for each outcome within each comparison using metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis where possible, and used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Included studies We included 12 studies with 17,868 participants. We excluded five NRSIs from outcome analyses due to critical risk of bias related to confounding. Synthesis of results One threshold for initiating transfusion versus another threshold for initiating transfusion None of the studies assessed this comparison. OneÃ¢â‚¬Â to twoÃ¢â‚¬Âunit RBCs versus no transfusion Among women with moderate blood loss, lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence from one NRSI found that transfusing 1 to 2 units of RBCs to treat PPH may increase severe maternal morbidity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ composite excluding intensive care unit (ICU) admission (risk ratio (RR) 7.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.75 to 17.80; 2130 women) and severe maternal morbidity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ICU admission (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.75; 2130 women), though we have substantial concerns about the potential bias due to confounding as the volume of blood lost was not controlled for in the analysis. The study did not report maternal death or adverse effects. Packed RBCs versus whole blood versus combination of blood products One NRSI assessed this comparison but had critical risk of bias and was subsequently excluded from analysis. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP)/RBCs with fibrinogen concentrate versus FFP/RBCs alone One NRSI assessed this comparison but had critical risk of bias and was subsequently excluded from analysis. Fibrinogen concentrate versus placebo or no fibrinogen concentrate The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of fibrinogen concentrate on maternal death (0 events; 2 studies, 674 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Fibrinogen concentrate probably results in little to no difference in severe maternal morbidity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ICU admission (RR 1.09,0 95% CI 0.80 to 1.49; 2 studies, 485 women; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of fibrinogen concentrate on severe maternal morbidity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ arterial embolisation (1 study, 430 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). One RCT (430 women) and one NRSI (730 women) reported severe maternal morbidity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hysterectomy , each of which reported different directions of effect with lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence. Fibrinogen concentrate may result in little to no difference in adverse effect Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thromboembolic events (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.95; 2 studies, 674 women; l wÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of fibrinogen concentrate on additional adverse effects, such as shivering or fever (1 study, 244 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Cryoprecipitate versus no cryoprecipitate The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of cryoprecipitate on maternal death . One RCT (0 deaths; 180 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and one NRSI (0 deaths; 157 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) reported this outcomes. The evidence is also very uncertain about the effects of cryoprecipitate on severe maternal morbidity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ICU admission , severe maternal morbidity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ any organ failure , severe maternal morbidity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ laparotomy , or severe maternal morbidity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ uterine artery embolisation (1 study, 180 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). One RCT (180 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) and one NRSI (157 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) reported severe maternal morbidity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ hysterectomy and the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence is also very uncertain about the effects of cryoprecipitate on adverse effects, such as thromboembolic events or transfusionÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated reactions (1 study, 180 women; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Massive transfusion protocol versus no massive transfusion protocol Two NRSIs assessed this comparison but had critical risk of bias and were subsequently excluded from analysis. Authors' conclusions Overall, available evidence for the effects of blood and blood product transfusion on priority maternal outcomes is largely uncertain. LowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence suggests that 1 to 2 units of RBC transfusion may increase the risk of severe maternal morbidity; however, we urge caution when interpreting this finding as the effect estimates are at serious risk of bias due to possible confounding. We are unable to comment on the effects of larger blood transfusion amounts on severe maternal morbidity. Funding This review received no dedicated funding. Registration This protocol for this Cochrane review is registered with PROSPERO. Available from: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024599608 . Plain language summary What are the benefits and harms of transfusions of blood and blood products for managing postpartum haemorrhage? Key messages The best time for women to begin receiving an allogeneic blood transfusion (where blood from a donor is injected into the woman's bloodstream through a vein) to reduce complications from excessive blood loss within 24 hours of birth (postpartum haemorrhage) is unknown. The effect of blood products (substances produced from whole blood) instead of, or in addition to, whole blood transfusion on reducing complications of postpartum haemorrhage is largely uncertain. What is postpartum haemorrhage? Postpartum haemorrhage is heavy bleeding after birth. It is commonly defined as a blood loss of 500 mL or more within 24 hours of birth. Worldwide, it is one of the leading causes of maternal death. How is postpartum haemorrhage treated? There are presently no guidelines on how postpartum haemorrhage should be treated, but transfusions of whole blood or parts of the blood (called blood products, such as fresh frozen plasma, which is made from the liquid part of the blood) can be used to manage postpartum haemorrhage and prevent complications among women who are actively bleeding. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out the benefits and harms of different transfusion treatments for managing postpartum haemorrhage, which women should begin receiving a blood transfusion and when, and which blood products, alone or in combination, are best. What did we do? We searched for studies that evaluated the benefits and harms of blood transfusion for managing postpartum haemorrhage. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 12 studies with 17,868 women. We were able to use eight of these studies as four had problems with study design We found no certain evidence on when to start blood transfusion or on whether using blood products instead of, or in addition to, whole blood transfusion reduces complications of postpartum haemorrhage. Overall, we had very little confidence in the findings. Several factors affected this. Many studies did not randomly place women into the different treatment groups. This means that differences between the groups could have been due to differences between women rather than between the treatments. While some studies did randomly place women into the treatment groups, we had concerns about how this was done. A few studies were small and the results varied. What are the limitations of the evidence? We could not draw any conclusions on the benefits and harms of blood transfusions for postpartum haemorrhage management with any certainty because the studies produced findings in which we have very little overall confidence.

J6293,2025,Economic evaluation of personalised versus conventional risk assessment for women who have undergone testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer genes: A modelling study,"Background: The management of women with germline pathogenic variants (GPVs) in breast (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC) susceptibility genes is focused on surveillance and risk-reducing surgery/medication. Most women are assigned an average range of risk and treated accordingly, but it is possible to personalise this. Here, we explore the economic impact of risk personalisation. Method(s): We compared two strategies for risk stratification for female participants: conventional risk assessment (CRA), which only involves information from genetic testing and personalised risk assessment (PRA), using genetic and non-genetic risk modifiers. Three different versions of PRA were compared, which were combinations of polygenic risk score and questionnaire-based factors. A patient-level Markov model was designed to estimate the overall National Health Service cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) after risk assessment. Results were given for 20 different groups of women based on their GPV status and family history. Result(s): Across the 20 scenarios, the results showed that PRA was cost-effective compared with CRA using a 20 000 per QALY threshold in women with a GPV in PALB2 who have OC or BC+OC family history, and women with a GPV in ATM, CHEK2, RAD51C or RAD51D. For women with a GPV in BRCA1 or BRCA2, women with no pathogenic variant and women with a GPV in PALB2 who have unknown family history or BC family history, CRA was more cost-effective. PRA was cost-effective compared with CRA in specific situations predominantly associated with moderate-risk BC GPVs (RAD51C/RAD51D/CHEK2/ATM), while CRA was cost-effective compared with PRA predominantly with high-risk BC GPVs (BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2). Conclusion(s): PRA was cost-effective in specific situations compared with CRA in the UK for assessment of women with or without GPVs in BC and OC susceptibility genes.

J6297,2025,TCTAP A-086 Implementing Vascular Scientist-Led Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (EVAR) Scans to Enhance the Patient Pathway in the United Kingdom,"Background: This project aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a Vascular Scientist-led contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) service for detecting Endo leaks following endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). By enabling Vascular Scientists to independently administer contrast agents, the project sought to reduce the reliance on Vascular Radiologists, optimize resource utilization and improve overall workflow efficiency. The key objectives were to streamline the patient pathway, reduce appointment waiting times, and make more efficient use of healthcare resources. Method(s): Previously, CEUS appointments for EVAR patients were scheduled around Vascular Radiologist availability, as Radiologists were responsible for the preparation and administration of contrast agents. This dependency often resulted in delays in appointment scheduling, creating bottlenecks in the workflow. To resolve these inefficiencies, an interdisciplinary collaboration was established between the Pharmacy Medicines Management, Learning and Development, Radiology, and Vascular Surgery departments. A comprehensive training and competency framework was developed to enable Vascular Scientists to safely prepare and administer contrast agents. The new service model was implemented in November 2023, allowing Vascular Scientists to lead the CEUS service independently. The effectiveness of this Vascular Scientist-led CEUS model was evaluated by comparing it to the previous Radiologist-led model. Key performance metrics such as average waiting times for appointments and scan durations were analyzed using pre-existing data from both before and after the implementation of the new model. Result(s): The implementation of the Vascular Scientist-led CEUS service demonstrated significant improvements in both appointment scheduling and scan duration. The average waiting time for a CEUS scan appointment decreased from 13 days (Radiologist-led) to 7 days (Vascular Scientist-led). Additionally, scan duration was reduced streamlining the overall patient experience. Importantly, the new pathway also allowed for a more efficient allocation of Radiologist and Vascular Scientist time, as Radiologists could focus on other critical diagnostic and interventional tasks, while Vascular Scientists fully managed the CEUS process. This redistribution of tasks resulted in not only a more efficient use of medical staff time but also significant cost savings for the National Health Service (NHS). By reducing patient waiting times and optimizing resource use, the service improved overall workflow efficiency without compromising the quality of patient care. Conclusion(s): The introduction of a Vascular Scientist-led CEUS service for detecting Endo leaks post-EVAR has proven to be a feasible and effective service improvement model. This initiative not only significantly reduced patient waiting times and scan duration but also optimized the roles of both Radiologists and Vascular Scientists, leading to better resource management and financial savings for the healthcare system. The program represents a significant advancement in the provision of vascular ultrasound services and highlights the expanding role of Vascular Scientists in patient care delivery. Moving forward, the service will undergo routine re-audit and quality assurance checks to ensure that safety, efficacy and patient outcomes are consistently maintained. This initiative paves the way for wider adoption of similar models in other medical imaging services, further developing the expertise of healthcare professionals and improving patient care pathways.

J6299,2025,Economic evaluation of non-invasive test pathways for high-risk metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in the United Kingdom (UK),"Introduction and Objectives: Non-invasive tests (NITs) identifying high-risk MASLD in primary care is suggested but, these strategies cost-effectiveness remain uncertain in the United Kingdom (UK). Material(s) and Method(s): A cost-utility/budget impact model was developed for cost-effectiveness evaluation of two screening strategies (1) FIB-4 followed by Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) (FIB-4/ELF); (2) FIB-4 followed by Transient Elastography (FIB-4/TE) compared to standard of care (SoC). A cohort of primary care MASLD patients with an advanced fibrosis prevalence of 4.20 % was simulated. A decision tree classified patients as true positives, false positives, true negatives, or false negatives based on NIT diagnostic accuracy, followed by a 3-year Markov model to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The model included 11 health states: MASLD, fibrosis stages (F0-F3), cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplant, and death. Costs came from the National Tariff, National Schedule of Costs and Personal Social Services Research Unit. Result(s): SoC had a false diagnosis rate of 36.26 %, while FIB-4 with ELF or TE reduced false positive rates to 23.20 % and 20.91 %, respectively. Compared to 112,807 unnecessary hepatology referrals under SoC, FIB-4/ELF or FIB-4/TE reduced unnecessary referrals by 38,031 (33.71 %) and 45,767 (40.57 %), respectively. Both strategies demonstrated cost-effectiveness relative to SoC with total cost per patient of GBP 983.37 for FIB-4/TE, GBP 993.15 for FIB-4/ELF compared to SoC, GBP 1,014.15. Conclusion(s): Sequential NIT screening strategies, combining FIB-4 with ELF or TE, are cost-saving, reduce unnecessary hepatology referrals, and offer an efficient (improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs) approach for managing high-risk MASLD in UK primary care.

J1787,2020,Is Protocolised Weaning that Includes Early Extubation Onto Non-Invasive Ventilation More Cost Effective Than Protocolised Weaning Without Non-Invasive Ventilation? Findings from the Breathe Study,"Background: Optimising techniques to wean patients from invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) remains a key goal of intensive care practice. The use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) as a weaning strategy (transitioning patients who are difficult to wean to early NIV) may reduce mortality, ventilator-associated pneumonia and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. Objective(s): Our objectives were to determine the cost effectiveness of protocolised weaning, including early extubation onto NIV, compared with weaning without NIV in a UK National Health Service setting. Method(s): We conducted an economic evaluation alongside a multicentre randomised controlled trial. Patients were randomised to either protocol-directed weaning from mechanical ventilation or ongoing IMV with daily spontaneous breathing trials. The primary efficacy outcome was time to liberation from ventilation. Bivariate regression of costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) provided estimates of the incremental cost per QALY and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) overall and for subgroups [presence/absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and operative status]. Long-term cost effectiveness was determined through extrapolation of survival curves using flexible parametric modelling. Result(s): NIV was associated with a mean INMB of 620 ($US885) (cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 per QALY) with a corresponding probability of 58% that NIV is cost effective. The probability that NIV is cost effective was higher for those with COPD (84%). NIV was cost effective over 5 years, with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 4618 ($US6594 per QALY gained). Conclusion(s): The probability of NIV being cost effective relative to weaning without NIV ranged between 57 and 59% overall and between 82 and 87% for the COPD subgroup.

J1789,2020,"Self-Monitoring and Management of Blood Pressure in Patients with Stroke or TIA: An Economic Evaluation of TEST-BP, A Randomised Controlled Trial","Background: Prevention of secondary stroke following initial ictus is an important focus of after-stroke care. Blood pressure (BP) is a key risk factor, so usual care following stroke or transient ischaemic attack includes regular BP checks and monitoring of anti-hypertensive medication. This is traditionally carried out in primary care, but the evidence supporting self-monitoring and self-guided management of BP in the general population with hypertension is growing. Objective(s): Our objective was to estimate the cost effectiveness of treatment as usual (TAU) versus (1) self-monitoring of BP (S-MON) and (2) self-monitoring and guided self-management of anti-hypertensive medication (S-MAN). Method(s): This was a within-trial economic evaluation of a randomised controlled trial estimating the incremental cost per 1 mmHg BP reduction and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over a 6-month time horizon from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). Result(s): Data were evaluable for 140 participants. Costs per patient were 473, 853 and 1035; mean reduction in systolic BP (SBP) was 3.6, 6.7 and 6.1 mmHg, and QALYs accrued were 0.427, 0.422 and 0.423 for TAU, S-MON and S-MAN, respectively. No statistically significant differences in incremental costs or outcomes were detected. On average, S-MAN was dominated or extended dominated. The incremental cost per 1 mmHg BP reduction from S-MON versus TAU was 137. Conclusion(s): On average, S-MAN is an inefficient intervention. S-MON may be cost effective, depending on the willingness to pay for a 1 mmHg BP reduction, although it yielded fewer QALYs over the within-trial time horizon. Decision modelling is required to explore the longer-term costs and outcomes.

J1793,2020,Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with liver cirrhosis: a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis,"- Background Approximately 2.5% of all hospitalisations in people with liver cirrhosis are for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is associated with significant shortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm mortality; therefore, it is important to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people at high risk of developing it. Antibiotic prophylaxis forms the mainstay preventive method, but this has to be balanced against the development of drugÃ¢â‚¬Âresistant spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is difficult to treat, and other adverse events. Several different prophylactic antibiotic treatments are available; however, there is uncertainty surrounding their relative efficacy and optimal combination. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of different prophylactic antibiotic treatments for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with liver cirrhosis using a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis and to generate rankings of the different prophylactic antibiotic treatments according to their safety and efficacy. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to November 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis at risk of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Selection criteria We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis undergoing prophylactic treatment to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation, or were receiving antibiotics for treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or other purposes. Data collection and analysis We performed a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an availableÃ¢â‚¬Âcase analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. Main results We included 29 randomised clinical trials (3896 participants; nine antibiotic regimens (ciprofloxacin, neomycin, norfloxacin, norfloxacin plus neomycin, norfloxacin plus rifaximin, rifaximin, rufloxacin, sparfloxacin, sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim), and 'no active intervention' in the review. TwentyÃ¢â‚¬Âthree trials (2587 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies, with or without other features of decompensation, having ascites with low protein or previous history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The followÃ¢â‚¬Âup in the trials ranged from 1 to 12 months. Many of the trials were at high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of evidence was low or very low. Overall, approximately 10% of trial participants developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and 15% of trial participants died. There was no evidence of differences between any of the antibiotics and no intervention in terms of mortality (very low certainty) or number of serious adverse events (very low certainty). However, because of the wide CrIs, clinically important differences in these outcomes cannot be ruled out. None of the trials reported healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life or the proportion of people with serious adverse events. There was no evidence of differences between any of the antibiotics and no intervention in terms of proportion of people with 'any adverse events' (very low certainty), liver transplantation (very low certainty), or the proportion of people who developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (very low certainty). The number of 'any' adverse events per participant was fewer with norfloxacin (rate ratio 0.74, 95% CrI 0.59 to 0.94; 4 trials, 546 participants; low certainty) and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim (rate ratio 0.19, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.81; 1 trial, 60 participants; low certainty) versus no activ intervention. There was no evidence of differences between the other antibiotics and no intervention in the number of 'any' adverse events per participant (very low certainty). There were fewer other decompensation events with rifaximin versus no active intervention (rate ratio 0.61, 65% CrI 0.46 to 0.80; 3 trials, 575 participants; low certainty) and norfloxacin plus neomycin (rate ratio 0.06, 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.33; 1 trial, 22 participants; low certainty). There was no evidence of differences between the other antibiotics and no intervention in the number of decompensations events per participant (very low certainty). None of the trials reported healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life or development of symptomatic spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. One would expect some correlation between the above outcomes, with interventions demonstrating effectiveness across several outcomes. This was not the case. The possible reasons for this include sparse data and selective reporting bias, which makes the results unreliable. Therefore, one cannot draw any conclusions from these inconsistent differences based on sparse data. There was no evidence of any differences in the subgroup analyses (performed when possible) based on whether the prophylaxis was primary or secondary. Funding: the source of funding for five trials were organisations who would benefit from the results of the study; six trials received no additional funding or were funded by neutral organisations; and the source of funding for the remaining 18 trials was unclear. Authors' conclusions Based on very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, there is considerable uncertainty about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is beneficial, and if beneficial, which antibiotic prophylaxis is most beneficial in people with cirrhosis and ascites with low protein or history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered, employ blinding, avoid postrandomisation dropouts (or perform intentionÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âtreat analysis), and use clinically important outcomes such as mortality, healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life, and decompensation events. Plain language summary Use of antibiotics to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with advanced liver disease What was the aim of this Cochrane Review? People with advanced liver disease (liver cirrhosis, or lateÃ¢â‚¬Âstage scarring of the liver with complications) are at risk of developing an abnormal buildÃ¢â‚¬Âup of fluid in the tummy, called ascites. This fluid may get infected with bacteria, without one knowing the cause. This is called 'spontaneous bacterial peritonitis'. It is important to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people at high risk of developing it, because it is associated with a significant risk of death. Antibiotics are often used in people with advanced liver disease and ascites as a means to help prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but it is unclear whether they are effective and if effective, which antibiotic is the most effective. We aimed to determine the best available antibiotic treatment (if any) for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with advanced liver disease. We collected and analysed all relevant research studies and found 29 randomised clinical trials (participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups). During analysis of data, we used standard Cochrane techniques, allowing direct comparison of only two treatments at a time. We also used advanced techniques, allowing indirect comparisons of more than two treatments simultaneously (usually referred as 'network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis'). The aim was to gather reliable direct and indirect evidence. Date of literature search November 2018. Key messages Only two small studies were conducted without flaws, and because of the very high uncertainty in the obtained analysis results, the authors could not say whether antibiotics work and, if they work, which one to use. Out of 1564 participants, 10% of people with cirrhosis and ascites developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and out f 2169 participants, about 15% died within 12 months. Funding source was unclear in 18 studies. Drug companies funded five studies. There were no concerns regarding the source of funding for the remaining six studies. What did the review study? We studied adults with advanced liver disease due to various causes, and who were undergoing preventive treatment to avoid developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Participants received different antibiotics or no antibiotics. We excluded studies in people who had previously undergone liver transplantation, and where people received antibiotics for the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or for any other reason. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 42 to 63 years. The administered antibiotic types were quinolones, rifamycins, sulfonamides, and aminoglycosides. The authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, quality of life, serious and nonÃ¢â‚¬Âserious side effects, time to liver transplantation, time to development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, time to development of other complications of advanced liver disease, and length of hospital stay. What were the main results of the review? The 29 studies included a small number of participants (3896 participants). Study data were sparse. TwentyÃ¢â‚¬Âthree studies with 2587 participants provided data for analyses. The followÃ¢â‚¬Âup in the trials ranged from 1 to 12 months. The review shows that: Ã¢â‚¬Â of the 10 different antibiotics compared in the trials, norfloxacin and rifaximin were most commonly used;Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â 15 of every 100 people died within 12 months, and 10 of every 100 people developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis;Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â giving preventive antibiotics may make no difference to the percentage of deaths or people with serious complications; however, potentially important differences cannot be ruled out;Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â none of the trials reported quality of life or symptomatic development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis;Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â there was evidence showing that the percentage of people who developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as per laboratory criteria may be reduced with sulfonamides compared with no use of antibiotics (difficult to estimate how much reduction);Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â there was evidence of differences in other outcomes such as any complications, liver transplantation, and other signs of liver failure, but these differences were not consistent. Therefore, the results are unreliable, and we cannot draw any conclusions about how effective antibiotics are;Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Ã¢â‚¬Â future wellÃ¢â‚¬Âdesigned trials are needed.

J1800,2020,Interventions to reduce contaminated aerosols produced during dental procedures for preventing infectious diseases,"- Background Many dental procedures produce aerosols (droplets, droplet nuclei and splatter) that harbour various pathogenic microÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âorganisms and may pose a risk for the spread of infections between dentist and patient. The COVIDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â19 pandemic has led to greater concern about this risk. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of methods used during dental treatment procedures to minimize aerosol production and reduce or neutralize contamination in aerosols. Search methods Cochrane Oral HealthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Information Specialist searched the following databases on 17 September 2020: Cochrane Oral HealthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946); Embase Ovid (from 1980); the WHO COVIDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov); and the Cochrane COVIDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â19 Study Register. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on aerosolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âgenerating procedures (AGPs) performed by dental healthcare providers that evaluated methods to reduce contaminated aerosols in dental clinics (excluding preprocedural mouthrinses). The primary outcomes were incidence of infection in dental staff or patients, and reduction in volume and level of contaminated aerosols in the operative environment. The secondary outcomes were cost, accessibility and feasibility. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from the included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies, and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and randomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffects metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis to combine data. We assessed heterogeneity. Main results We included 16 studies with 425 participants aged 5 to 69 years. Eight studies had high risk of bias; eight had unclear risk of bias. No studies measured infection. All studies measured bacterial contamination using the surrogate outcome of colonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âforming units (CFU). Two studies measured contamination per volume of air sampled at different distances from the patient's mouth, and 14 studies sampled particles on agar plates at specific distances from the patient's mouth. The results presented below should be interpreted with caution as the evidence is very low certainty due to heterogeneity, risk of bias, small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. Moreover, we do not know the 'minimal clinically important difference' in CFU. HighÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âvolume evacuator Use of a highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âvolume evacuator (HVE) may reduce bacterial contamination in aerosols less than one foot (~ 30 cm) from a patient's mouth (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢47.41, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢92.76 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢2.06; 3 splitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmouth RCTs, 122 participants; very high heterogeneity IÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â² = 95%), but not at longer distances (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢1.00, ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢2.56 to 0.56; 1 RCT, 80 participants). One splitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmouth RCT (six participants) found that HVE may not be more effective than conventional dental suction (saliva ejector or lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âvolume evacuator) at 40 cm (MD CFU ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢2.30, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢5.32 to 0.72) or 150 cm (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢2.20, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢14.01 to 9.61). Dental isolation combination system One RCT (50 participants) found that there may be no difference in CFU between a combination system (Isolite) and a saliva ejector (lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âvolume evacuator) during AGPs (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢0.31, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢0.82 to 0.20) or after AGPs (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢0.35, ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢0.99 to 0.29). However, an 'n of 1' design study showed that the combination system may reduce CFU compared with rubber dam plus HVE (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢125.20, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢174.02 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢76.38) or HVE (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢109.30, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢153.01 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢65.59). Rubber dam One splitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmouth RCT (10 participants) receiving dental treatment, found that there may be a reduction in CFU with rubber dam at oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmetre (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢16.20, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢19.36 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢13.04) and twoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmetre distance (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢11.70, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€  15.82 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢7.58). One RCT of 47 dental students found use of rubber dam may make no difference in CFU at the forehead (MD 0.98, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢0.73 to 2.70) and occipital region of the operator (MD 0.77, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢0.46 to 2.00). One splitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmouth RCT (21 participants) found that rubber dam plus HVE may reduce CFU more than cotton roll plus HVE on the patient's chest (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢251.00, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢267.95 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢234.05) and dental unit light (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢12.70, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢12.85 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢12.55). Air cleaning systems One splitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmouth CCT (two participants) used a local standÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âalone air cleaning system (ACS), which may reduce aerosol contamination during cavity preparation (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢66.70 CFU, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢120.15 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢13.25 per cubic metre) or ultrasonic scaling (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢32.40, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â 51.55 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢13.25). Another CCT (50 participants) found that laminar flow in the dental clinic combined with a HEPA filter may reduce contamination approximately 76 cm from the floor (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢483.56 CFU, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢550.02 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢417.10 per cubic feet per minute per patient) and 20 cm to 30 cm from the patient's mouth (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢319.14 CFU, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â 385.60 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢252.68). Disinfectants ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ antimicrobial coolants Two RCTs evaluated use of antimicrobial coolants during ultrasonic scaling. Compared with distilled water, coolant containing chlorhexidine (CHX), cinnamon extract coolant or povidone iodine may reduce CFU: CHX (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢124.00, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢135.78 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢112.22; 20 participants), povidone iodine (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢656.45, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢672.74 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢640.16; 40 participants), cinnamon (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢644.55, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢668.70 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢620.40; 40 participants). CHX coolant may reduce CFU more than povidone iodine (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢59.30, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢64.16 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢54.44; 20 participants), but not more than cinnamon extract (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢11.90, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢35.88 to 12.08; 40 participants). Authors' conclusions We found no studies that evaluated disease transmission via aerosols in a dental setting; and no evidence about viral contamination in aerosols. All of the included studies measured bacterial contamination using colonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âforming units. There appeared to be some benefit from the interventions evaluated but the available evidence is very low certainty so we are unable to draw reliable conclusions. We did not find any studies on methods such as ventilation, ionization, ozonisation, UV light and fogging. Studies are needed that measure contamination in aerosols, size distribution of aerosols and infection transmission risk for respiratory diseases such as COVIDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â19 in dental patients and staff. Plain language summary Do measures that aim to reduce aerosol production during dental procedures prevent the transmission of infectious diseases? Why is this question important? Most dental care procedures create tiny drops of liquid that float in the air, called aerosols. For example, to remove the film of bacteria (plaque) that builds on teeth, dentists use scaling machines (scalers). Scalers vibrate at high speed and use a flow of water to wash away the plaque. This produces aerosols that are made of air, water, and the patientÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s saliva, which may also contain microÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. Aerosols that contain bacteria, fungi or viruses can spread infectious diseases. Limiting the production of these aerosols could help to prevent disease transmission in a dental setting. A range of approaches can be used to reduce production of potentially infectious aerosols during dental procedures. These include: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â ways to decontaminate the mouth before aerosols are produced, for example by using antiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmicrobial mouthwash; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â ways to prevent aerosols from leaving the mouth (for example, placing a rubber sheet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ known as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“damÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ around the tooth that is to be treated, to isolate the treatment zone from saliva; or using a strawÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âlike suction tube known as a saliva ejector); ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â local ventilation using a suction device (known as a highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âvolume evacuator) that draws up a large volume of air and evacuates aerosols from the treatment zone; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â general ventilation, to reduce the concentration of aerosols in t e air, for example by keeping windows open; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â decontamination of airÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âborne aerosols, for example using ultraviolet light to sterilize the air. These can be used alone, or in combination. We analysed the evidence from research studies to find out whether interventions that aim to reduce aerosol production during dental procedures can prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. We also wanted to find out about the cost of the interventions, whether patients and dentists found them acceptable, and whether the interventions were easy to implement. How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature that compared interventions to reduce aerosol production during dental procedures against other interventions or no intervention. We then compared the results, and summarized the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorized the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. What did we find? We found 16 studies that involved a total of 425 people. Studies involved between one and 80 participants, who were aged between 5 and 69 years. Six studies were conducted in the USA, five in India, two in the UK and one each in Egypt, the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates. The studies evaluated one or more of the following devices: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âvolume evacuator (7 studies); ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â handsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âfree suction device (2 studies); ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â saliva ejector (1 study); ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â rubber dam (3 studies); ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â rubber dam with a highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âvolume evacuator (1 study); or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â air cleaning system (1 study). None of the studies evaluated the risk infectious disease transmission. Nor did they evaluate cost, acceptability or ease of implementation. All 16 studies measured changes in the levels of bacterial contamination in aerosols, but we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. This means that we have very little confidence in the evidence, and that we expect further research to change the findings of our review. We therefore cannot deduce from this evidence whether there is an effect on levels of bacterial contamination. No studies investigated viral or fungal contamination. What does this mean? We do not know whether interventions that aim to reduce aerosol production during dental procedures prevent the transmission of infectious diseases.

J1801,2020,Improving Workflow Efficiency for Mammography Using Machine Learning,"Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether machine learning could reduce the number of mammograms the radiologist must read by using a machine-learning classifier to correctly identify normal mammograms and to select the uncertain and abnormal examinations for radiological interpretation. Method(s): Mammograms in a research data set from over 7,000 women who were recalled for assessment at six UK National Health Service Breast Screening Program centers were used. A convolutional neural network in conjunction with multitask learning was used to extract imaging features from mammograms that mimic the radiological assessment provided by a radiologist, the patient's nonimaging features, and pathology outcomes. A deep neural network was then used to concatenate and fuse multiple mammogram views to predict both a diagnosis and a recommendation of whether or not additional radiological assessment was needed. Result(s): Ten-fold cross-validation was used on 2,000 randomly selected patients from the data set; the remainder of the data set was used for convolutional neural network training. While maintaining an acceptable negative predictive value of 0.99, the proposed model was able to identify 34% (95% confidence interval, 25%-43%) and 91% (95% confidence interval: 88%-94%) of the negative mammograms for test sets with a cancer prevalence of 15% and 1%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Machine learning was leveraged to successfully reduce the number of normal mammograms that radiologists need to read without degrading diagnostic accuracy.

J1804,2020,Virtual reality distraction for acute pain in children,"- Background Virtual reality (VR) computer technology creates a simulated environment, perceived as comparable to the real world, with which users can actively interact. The effectiveness of VR distraction on acute pain intensity in children is uncertain. Objectives To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of virtual reality (VR) distraction interventions for children (0 to 18 years) with acute pain in any healthcare setting. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and four trial registries to October 2019. We also searched reference lists of eligible studies, handsearched relevant journals and contacted study authors. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including crossÃ¢â‚¬Âover and clusterÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCTs, comparing VR distraction to no distraction, nonÃ¢â‚¬ÂVR distraction or other VR distraction. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological processes. Two reviewers assessed risk of bias and extracted data independently. The primary outcome was acute pain intensity (during procedure, and up to one hour postÃ¢â‚¬Âprocedure). Secondary outcomes were adverse effects, child satisfaction with VR, painÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated distress, parent anxiety, rescue analgesia and cost. We used GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables. Main results We included 17 RCTs (1008 participants aged four to 18 years) undergoing various procedures in healthcare settings. We did not pool data because the heterogeneity in population (i.e. diverse ages and developmental stages of children and their different perceptions and reactions to pain) and variations in procedural conditions (e.g. phlebotomy, burn wound dressings, physical therapy sessions), and consequent level of pain experienced, made statistical pooling of data impossible. We narratively describe results. We judged most studies to be at unclear risk of selection bias, high risk of performance and detection bias, and high risk of bias for small sample sizes. Across all comparisons and outcomes, we downgraded the certainty of evidence to low or very low due to serious study limitations and serious or very serious indirectness. We also downgraded some of the evidence for very serious imprecision. 1: VR distraction versus no distraction Acute pain intensity: during procedure SelfÃ¢â‚¬Âreport: one study (42 participants) found no beneficial effect of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âimmersive VR (very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). ObserverÃ¢â‚¬Âreport: no data. Behavioural measurements (observerÃ¢â‚¬Âreport): two studies, 62 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence. One study (n = 42) found no beneficial effect of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âimmersive VR. One study (n = 20) found a beneficial effect favouring immersive VR. Acute pain intensity: postÃ¢â‚¬Âprocedure SelfÃ¢â‚¬Âreport: 10 studies, 461 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence. Four studies (n = 95) found no beneficial effect of immersive and semiÃ¢â‚¬Âimmersive or nonÃ¢â‚¬Âimmersive VR. Five studies (n = 357) found a beneficial effect favouring immersive VR. Another study (n = 9) reported less pain in the VR group. ObserverÃ¢â‚¬Âreport: two studies (216 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) found a beneficial effect of immersive VR, as reported by primary caregiver/parents or nurses. One study (n = 80) found a beneficial effect of immersive VR, as reported by researchers. Behavioural measurements (observerÃ¢â‚¬Âreport): one study (42 participants) found no beneficial effect of nonÃ¢â‚¬Âimmersive VR (very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Adverse effects: five studies, 154 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence. Three studies (n = 53) reported no adverse effects. Two studies (n = 101) reported mild adverse effects (e.g. nausea) in the VR group. 2: VR distraction versus other nonÃ¢â‚¬ÂVR distraction Acute pain intensity: during procedure SelfÃ¢â‚¬Âreport, observerÃ¢â‚¬Âreport and behavioural measurements (observerÃ¢â‚¬Âreport): two studies, 106 participants: SelfÃ¢â‚¬Âreport: one study (n = 65) found a beneficial effect favouring immersive VR and one (n = 41) found no evidence of a difference in mean pain change scores (very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) ObserverÃ¢â‚¬Âreport: one study (n = 65) found a beneficial effect favouring immersive VR and one (n = 41) found no evidence of a difference in mean pain change scores (lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Behavioural measurements (observerÃ¢â‚¬Âreport): one study (n = 65) found a beneficial effect favouring immersive VR and one (n = 41) reported a difference in mean pain change scores with fewer pain behaviours in VR group (lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Acute pain intensity: postÃ¢â‚¬Âprocedure SelfÃ¢â‚¬Âreport: eight studies, 575 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence. Two studies (n = 146) found a beneficial effect favouring immersive VR. Two studies (n = 252) reported a betweenÃ¢â‚¬Âgroup difference favouring immersive VR. One study (n = 59) found no beneficial effect of immersive VR versus television and Child Life nonÃ¢â‚¬ÂVR distraction. One study (n = 18) found no beneficial effect of semiÃ¢â‚¬Âimmersive VR. Two studies (n = 100) reported no betweenÃ¢â‚¬Âgroup difference. ObserverÃ¢â‚¬Âreport: three studies, 187 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence. One study (n = 81) found a beneficial effect favouring immersive VR for parent, nurse and researcher reports. One study (n = 65) found a beneficial effect favouring immersive VR for caregiver reports. Another study (n = 41) reported no evidence of a difference in mean pain change scores. Behavioural measurements (observerÃ¢â‚¬Âreport): two studies, 106 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence. One study (n = 65) found a beneficial effect favouring immersive VR. Another study (n = 41) reported no evidence of a difference in mean pain change scores. Adverse effects: six studies, 429 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence. Three studies (n = 229) found no evidence of a difference between groups. Two studies (n = 141) reported no adverse effects in VR group. One study (n = 59) reported no beneficial effect in reducing estimated cyberÃ¢â‚¬Âsickness before and after VR immersion. 3: VR distraction versus other VR distraction We did not identify any studies for this comparison. Authors' conclusions We found lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty and very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence of the effectiveness of VR distraction compared to no distraction or other nonÃ¢â‚¬ÂVR distraction in reducing acute pain intensity in children in any healthcare setting. This level of uncertainty makes it difficult to interpret the benefits or lack of benefits of VR distraction for acute pain in children. Most of the review primary outcomes were assessed by only two or three small studies. We found limited data for adverse effects and other secondary outcomes. Future wellÃ¢â‚¬Âdesigned, large, highÃ¢â‚¬Âquality trials may have an important impact on our confidence in the results. Plain language summary What are the benefits and risks of using virtual reality in a healthcare setting to distract children from pain? Why is this question important? Medical procedures, such as health examinations or injections, can cause children to experience pain. In these situations, it is common practice to distract children using toys or play, in order to minimise distress and fear of pain. One form of distraction that can be used is virtual reality. Virtual reality is an artificial environment with scenes and objects that appear to be real (for example a frozen world, or a wildlife park). Virtual reality can be: Ã¢â‚¬Â FullyÃ¢â‚¬Âimmersive: users typically wear a headset with headphones and a screen, and interact with the virtual environment as if they were really in it. Ã¢â‚¬Â SemiÃ¢â‚¬Âimmersive: users interact with a partially virtual environment (for example, a flight simulator where the controls are real, but the windows display virtual images). Ã¢â‚¬Â NonÃ¢â‚¬Âimmersive: the user is connected to the virtual world by a separate monitor (for example, a computer) but can still experience the real world. To find out whether virtual reality can distract children from pain, and whether it is associated with any adverse (unwanted) effects, we reviewed the research evidence. How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical tudies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We compared and summarized their results. Finally, we rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes, and the consistency of findings across studies. What did we find? We found 17 studies that involved a total of 1008 children aged from four to 18 years. Medical procedures included injections, taking blood, changing wound dressings, and physical exercise. Studies compared virtual reality against no distraction, or against nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvirtual distraction. No studies compared different types of virtual reality. During a medical procedure We cannot tell whether virtual reality reduces selfÃ¢â‚¬Âreported pain during a medical procedure because we have too little confidence in the evidence available (three studies). Only two studies investigated changes in pain assessed by an observer (for example, using a rating scale that ranges from 0 (no pain) to 10 (great pain)). These reported conflicting findings: in one study fullyÃ¢â‚¬Âimmersive virtual reality was beneficial compared to nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvirtual distraction, but not in the other. FullyÃ¢â‚¬Âimmersive virtual reality may reduce pain assessed by an observer based on children's behaviour (for example, crying, or rubbing a body part in a way that indicates pain) more effectively than nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvirtual distraction (two studies) or no distraction (one study). NonÃ¢â‚¬Âimmersive virtual reality was not beneficial for pain assessed by an observer based on children's behaviour compared to no distraction (one study). A fter a medical procedure We cannot tell whether virtual reality can reduce selfÃ¢â‚¬Âreported pain after a medical procedure, as we have too little confidence in the evidence available (16 studies). Five studies investigated changes in pain assessed by an observer. Virtual reality was beneficial compared to no distraction in two studies, and also when compared to nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvirtual distraction in another two studies. However, it was no better than nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvirtual distraction in one study. Two studies investigating pain assessed by an observer based on children's behaviour reported conflicting findings: immersive virtual reality was beneficial compared to nonÃ¢â‚¬Âvirtual distraction in one study, but not in the other. We cannot tell whether there is a difference between virtual reality and no distraction for pain assessed by an observer based on children's behaviour, as we have too little confidence in the available evidence (one study). Adverse effects We cannot tell if virtual reality is associated with adverse effects because we have too little confidence in the evidence available (11 studies). What does this mean? We have little to very little confidence in the evidence we identified. It is unclear from our review whether virtual reality distraction makes a difference to pain in children. There is a need for large, wellÃ¢â‚¬Âdesigned studies in this area. How upÃ¢â‚¬Âto date is this review?

J1806,2020,Organised inpatient (stroke unit) care for stroke: network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis,"- Background Organised inpatient (stroke unit) care is provided by multiÃ¢â‚¬Âdisciplinary teams that manage stroke patients. This can been provided in a ward dedicated to stroke patients (stroke ward), with a peripatetic stroke team (mobile stroke team), or within a generic disability service (mixed rehabilitation ward). Team members aim to provide coÃ¢â‚¬Âordinated multiÃ¢â‚¬Âdisciplinary care using standard approaches to manage common postÃ¢â‚¬Âstroke problems. Objectives Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ To assess the effects of organised inpatient (stroke unit) care compared with an alternative service. Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ To use a network metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis (NMA) approach to assess different types of organised inpatient (stroke unit) care for people admitted to hospital after a stroke (the standard comparator was care in a general ward). Originally, we conducted this systematic review to clarify: Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The characteristic features of organised inpatient (stroke unit) care? Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Whether organised inpatient (stroke unit) care provide better patient outcomes than alternative forms of care? Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ If benefits are apparent across a range of patient groups and across different approaches to delivering organised stroke unit care? Within the current version, we wished to establish whether previous conclusions were altered by the inclusion of new outcome data from recent trials and further analysis via NMA. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (2 April 2019); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 4), in the Cochrane Library (searched 2 April 2019); MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 1 April 2019); Embase Ovid (1974 to 1 April 2019); and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL; 1982 to 2 April 2019). In an effort to identify further published, unpublished, and ongoing trials, we searched seven trial registries (2 April 2019). We also performed citation tracking of included studies, checked reference lists of relevant articles, and contacted trialists. Selection criteria Randomised controlled clinical trials comparing organised inpatient stroke unit care with an alternative service (typically contemporary conventional care), including comparing different types of organised inpatient (stroke unit) care for people with stroke who are admitted to hospital. Data collection and analysis Two review authors assessed eligibility and trial quality. We checked descriptive details and trial data with coÃ¢â‚¬Âordinators of the original trials, assessed risk of bias, and applied GRADE. The primary outcome was poor outcome (death or dependency (Rankin score 3 to 5) or requiring institutional care) at the end of scheduled followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. Secondary outcomes included death, institutional care, dependency, subjective health status, satisfaction, and length of stay. We used direct (pairwise) comparisons to compare organised inpatient (stroke unit) care with an alternative service. We used an NMA to confirm the relative effects of different approaches. Main results We included 29 trials (5902 participants) that compared organised inpatient (stroke unit) care with an alternative service: 20 trials (4127 participants) compared organised (stroke unit) care with a general ward, six trials (982 participants) compared different forms of organised (stroke unit) care, and three trials (793 participants) incorporated more than one comparison. Compared with the alternative service, organised inpatient (stroke unit) care was associated with improved outcomes at the end of scheduled followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (median one year): poor outcome (odds ratio (OR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.87; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence), death (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence), death or institutional care (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence), and death or dependency (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.85; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). Evidence was of very low quality for subjective health status and was not available for patient satisfaction. Analysis of length of stay was complicated by variations in definitio and measurement plus substantial statistical heterogeneity (IÃ‚Â² = 85%). There was no indication that organised stroke unit care resulted in a longer hospital stay. Sensitivity analyses indicated that observed benefits remained when the analysis was restricted to securely randomised trials that used unequivocally blinded outcome assessment with a fixed period of followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. Outcomes appeared to be independent of patient age, sex, initial stroke severity, stroke type, and duration of followÃ¢â‚¬Âup. When calculated as the absolute risk difference for every 100 participants receiving stroke unit care, this equates to two extra survivors, six more living at home, and six more living independently. The analysis of different types of organised (stroke unit) care used both direct pairwise comparisons and NMA. Direct comparison of stroke ward versus general ward: 15 trials (3523 participants) compared care in a stroke ward with care in general wards. Stroke ward care showed a reduction in the odds of a poor outcome at the end of followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.91; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). Direct comparison of mobile stroke team versus general ward: two trials (438 participants) compared care from a mobile stroke team with care in general wards. Stroke team care may result in little difference in the odds of a poor outcome at the end of followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.22; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). Direct comparison of mixed rehabilitation ward versus general ward: six trials (630 participants) compared care in a mixed rehabilitation ward with care in general wards. Mixed rehabilitation ward care showed a reduction in the odds of a poor outcome at the end of followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.90; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). In a NMA using care in a general ward as the comparator, the odds of a poor outcome were as follows: stroke ward Ã¢â‚¬Â OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.89, moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence; mobile stroke team Ã¢â‚¬Â OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.34, lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence; mixed rehabilitation ward Ã¢â‚¬Â OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95, lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence. Authors' conclusions We found moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence that stroke patients who receive organised inpatient (stroke unit) care are more likely to be alive, independent, and living at home one year after the stroke. The apparent benefits were independent of patient age, sex, initial stroke severity, or stroke type, and were most obvious in units based in a discrete stroke ward. We observed no systematic increase in the length of inpatient stay, but these findings had considerable uncertainty. Plain language summary Organised inpatient (stroke unit) care Review question Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Does organised inpatient (stroke unit) care improve the recovery of people with stroke in hospital compared with conventional care in general wards? Background Ã¢â‚¬Â¨Organised inpatient (stroke unit) care is a form of care provided in hospital by nurses, doctors, and therapists who specialise in looking after people with stroke. They aim to work as a coÃ¢â‚¬Âordinated team to provide the most appropriate care tailored to the needs of individual people with stroke. Study characteristics Ã¢â‚¬Â¨We identified 29 trials involving 5902 participants (search completed 2 April 2019). Participants who were recruited had had a recent stroke and required admission to hospital. Organised inpatient (stroke unit) care was provided in a variety of ways including stroke ward (care provided in a discrete stroke ward), mixed rehabilitation ward (setting seeking to improve care for people with stroke within a mixed rehabilitation ward), and mobile stroke team (peripatetic team looking after people with stroke across a range of wards). Key results Ã¢â‚¬Â¨At an average of 12 months after their stroke, people who received organised inpatient (stroke unit) care were more likely to be alive (an extra two people surviving for every 100 receiving stroke unit care; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) and living at home (an extra six patients for every 100 receiving stroke unit care; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). They also were more lik ly to be independent in daily activities (an extra six patients for every 100 receiving stroke unit care; moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence). The apparent benefits were seen in men and women, older and younger patients, and people with different types of stroke and different stroke severity. Benefits were most obvious when the stroke unit was based in a discrete stroke ward. Quality of the evidence Ã¢â‚¬Â¨We downgraded the quality of evidence to 'moderate' for the main outcomes because it was impossible to hide the treating service from participants or healthcare workers. These conclusions were not dependent on trials judged to be of lower quality because of poor design or missing data. More information was missing for some of the other outcome measures and analyses, which we have downgraded to lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence. Conclusion Ã¢â‚¬Â¨People with stroke who receive organised inpatient (stroke unit) care are more likely to be alive, living at home, and independent in looking after themselves one year after their stroke. Apparent benefits were seen across a broad range of people with stroke. Various types of stroke units have been developed. The best results appear to come from stroke units based in a dedicated stroke ward.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Study occurs in hospital stroke units.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article from Cochrane database.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative study with primary outcomes on clinical impact.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,"['clinical', 'utilization']",0.95
J1807,2020,Telerehabilitation services for stroke,"- Background Telerehabilitation offers an alternate way of delivering rehabilitation services. Information and communication technologies are used to facilitate communication between the healthcare professional and the patient in a remote location. The use of telerehabilitation is becoming more viable as the speed and sophistication of communication technologies improve. However, it is currently unclear how effective this model of delivery is relative to rehabilitation delivered faceÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âface or when added to usual care. Objectives To determine whether the use of telerehabilitation leads to improved ability to perform activities of daily living amongst stroke survivors when compared with (1) inÃ¢â‚¬Âperson rehabilitation (when the clinician and the patient are at the same physical location and rehabilitation is provided faceÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âface); or (2) no rehabilitation or usual care. Secondary objectives were to determine whether use of telerehabilitation leads to greater independence in selfÃ¢â‚¬Âcare and domestic life and improved mobility, balance, healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life, depression, upper limb function, cognitive function or functional communication when compared with inÃ¢â‚¬Âperson rehabilitation and no rehabilitation. Additionally, we aimed to report on the presence of adverse events, costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness, feasibility and levels of user satisfaction associated with telerehabilitation interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library , Issue 6, 2019), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to June 2019), Embase (1974 to June 2019), and eight additional databases. We searched trial registries and reference lists. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of telerehabilitation in stroke. We included studies that compared telerehabilitation with inÃ¢â‚¬Âperson rehabilitation or no rehabilitation. In addition, we synthesised and described the results of RCTs that compared two different methods of delivering telerehabilitation services without an alternative group. We included rehabilitation programmes that used a combination of telerehabilitation and inÃ¢â‚¬Âperson rehabilitation provided that the greater proportion of intervention was provided via telerehabilitation. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified trials on the basis of prespecified inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author moderated any disagreements. The review authors contacted investigators to ask for missing information. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence and interpret findings. Main results We included 22 trials in the review involving a total of 1937 participants. The studies ranged in size from the inclusion of 10 participants to 536 participants, and reporting quality was often inadequate, particularly in relation to random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data were apparent in several studies . Study interventions and comparisons varied, meaning that, in many cases, it was inappropriate to pool studies. Intervention approaches included postÃ¢â‚¬Âhospital discharge support programs, upper limb training, lower limb and mobility retraining and communication therapy for people with postÃ¢â‚¬Âstroke language disorders. Studies were either conducted upon discharge from hospital or with people in the subacute or chronic phases following stroke. Primary outcome: we found moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence that there was no difference in activities of daily living between people who received a postÃ¢â‚¬Âhospital discharge telerehabilitation intervention and those who received usual care (based on 2 studies with 661 participants (standardised mean difference (SMD) Ã¢â‚¬Â0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) Ã¢â‚¬Â0.15 to 0.15)). We found lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence of no difference in effects on activities of daily living between telerehabilitation and inÃ¢â‚¬Âperson physical therapy programmes (based on 2 studies w th 75 participants: SMD 0.03, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.43 to 0.48). Secondary outcomes: we found a low quality of evidence that there was no difference between telerehabilitation and inÃ¢â‚¬Âperson rehabilitation for balance outcomes (based on 3 studies with 106 participants: SMD 0.08, 95%CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.30 to 0.46). Pooling of three studies with 569 participants showed moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence that there was no difference between those who received postÃ¢â‚¬Âdischarge support interventions and those who received usual care on healthÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated quality of life (SMD 0.03, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.14 to 0.20). Similarly, pooling of six studies (with 1145 participants) found moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence that there was no difference in depressive symptoms when comparing postÃ¢â‚¬Âdischarge teleÃ¢â‚¬Âsupport programs with usual care (SMD Ã¢â‚¬Â0.04, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.19 to 0.11). We found no difference between groups for upper limb function (based on 3 studies with 170 participants: mean difference (MD) 1.23, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â2.17 to 4.64, lowÃ¢â‚¬Âquality evidence) when a computer program was used to remotely retrain upper limb function in comparison to inÃ¢â‚¬Âperson therapy. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of telerehabilitation on mobility or participant satisfaction with the intervention. No studies evaluated the costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness of telerehabilitation; however, five of the studies reported health service utilisation outcomes or costs of the interventions provided within the study. Two studies reported on adverse events, although no serious trialÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated adverse events were reported. Authors' conclusions While there is now an increasing number of RCTs testing the efficacy of telerehabilitation, it is hard to draw conclusions about the effects as interventions and comparators varied greatly across studies. In addition, there were few adequately powered studies and several studies included in this review were at risk of bias. At this point, there is only low or moderateÃ¢â‚¬Âlevel evidence testing whether telerehabilitation is a more effective or similarly effective way to provide rehabilitation. ShortÃ¢â‚¬Âterm postÃ¢â‚¬Âhospital discharge telerehabilitation programmes have not been shown to reduce depressive symptoms, improve quality of life, or improve independence in activities of daily living when compared with usual care. Studies comparing telerehabilitation and inÃ¢â‚¬Âperson therapy have also not found significantly different outcomes between groups, suggesting that telerehabilitation is not inferior. Some studies reported that telerehabilitation was less expensive to provide but information was lacking about costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness. Only two trials reported on whether or not any adverse events had occurred; these trials found no serious adverse events were related to telerehabilitation. The field is still emerging and more studies are needed to draw more definitive conclusions. In addition, while this review examined the efficacy of telerehabilitation when tested in randomised trials, studies that use mixed methods to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of telehealth interventions are incredibly valuable in measuring outcomes. Plain language summary Telerehabilitation services for stroke Review question Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ This review aimed to gather evidence for the use of telerehabilitation after stroke. We aimed to compare telerehabilitation with therapy delivered faceÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âface and with no therapy (usual care). Background Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ Stroke is a common cause of disability in adults. After a stroke, it is common for the individual to have difficulty managing everyday activities such as walking, showering, dressing, and participating in community activities. Many people need rehabilitation after stroke; this is usually provided by healthcare professionals in a hospital or clinic setting. Recent studies have investigated whether it is possible to use technologies such as the telephone or the Internet to help people communicate with healthcare professionals without having to leave their home. This approach, which is called telerehabilitation, may be a more convenient and less xpensive way of providing rehabilitation. Telerehabilitation may be used to improve a range of outcomes including physical functioning and mood. Study characteristics Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ We searched for studies in June 2019 and identified 22 studies involving 1937 people after stroke. The studies used a wide range of treatments, including therapy programmes designed to improve arm function and ability to walk and programmes designed to provide counselling and support for people upon leaving hospital after stroke. Key results Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ As the studies were very different, it was rarely appropriate to combine results to determine overall effect. We found that people who received telerehabilitation had similar outcomes for activities of daily living function to those that received faceÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âface therapy and those that received no therapy (usual care). At this point, not enough research has been done to show whether telerehabilitation is a more effective way to provide rehabilitation. Some studies report that telerehabilitation is less expensive to provide but information is lacking about costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness. Only two trials reported on whether or not any adverse events had occurred; these trials found no serious adverse events were related to telerehabilitation. Further trials are required. Quality of the evidence Ã¢â‚¬Â¨ The quality of the evidence was generally of low or moderate quality. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was limited due to small numbers of study participants and poor reporting of study details.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Telerehabilitation implies community or home health setting.,TRUE,"Unclear publication type, flagged for review",Unknown,0.7,TRUE,Comparative RCT with primary outcomes on clinical and PROs.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,"['clinical', 'pro']",0.95
J1809,2020,Behavioural modification interventions for medically unexplained symptoms in primary care: systematic reviews and economic evaluation,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: The term 'medically unexplained symptoms' is used to cover a wide range of persistent bodily complaints for which adequate examination and appropriate investigations do not reveal sufficiently explanatory structural or other specified pathologies. A wide range of interventions may be delivered to patients presenting with medically unexplained symptoms in primary care. Many of these therapies aim to change the behaviours of the individual who may have worsening symptoms.
<b>OBJECTIVES</b>: An evidence synthesis to determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of behavioural modification interventions for medically unexplained symptoms delivered in primary care settings was undertaken. Barriers to and facilitators of the effectiveness and acceptability of these interventions from the perspective of patients and service providers were evaluated through qualitative review and realist synthesis.
<b>DATA SOURCES</b>: Full search strategies were developed to identify relevant literature. Eleven electronic sources were searched. Eligibility criteria - for the review of clinical effectiveness, randomised controlled trials were sought. For the qualitative review, UK studies of any design were included. For the cost-effectiveness review, papers were restricted to UK studies reporting outcomes as quality-adjusted life-year gains. Clinical searches were conducted in November 2015 and December 2015, qualitative searches were conducted in July 2016 and economic searches were conducted in August 2016. The databases searched included MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO and EMBASE. Updated searches were conducted in February 2019 and March 2019.
<b>PARTICIPANTS</b>: Adult participants meeting the criteria for medically unexplained symptoms, including somatoform disorders, chronic unexplained pain and functional somatic syndromes.
<b>INTERVENTIONS</b>: Behavioural interventions were categorised into types. These included psychotherapies, exercise-based interventions, multimodal therapies (consisting of more than one intervention type), relaxation/stretching/social support/emotional support, guided self-help and general practitioner interventions, such as reattribution. Evidence synthesis: a network meta-analysis was conducted to allow a simultaneous comparison of all evaluated interventions in a single coherent analysis. Separate network meta-analyses were performed at three time points: end of treatment, short-term follow-up (< 6 months since the end of treatment) and long-term follow-up (>= 6 months after the end of treatment). Outcomes included physical and psychological symptoms, physical functioning and impact of the illness on daily activities. Economic evaluation: within-trial estimates of cost-effectiveness were generated for the subset of studies where utility values (or quality-adjusted life-years) were reported or where these could be estimated by mapping from Short Form questionnaire-36 items or Short Form questionnaire-12 items outcomes.
<b>RESULTS</b>: Fifty-nine studies involving 9077 patients were included in the clinical effectiveness review. There was a large degree of heterogeneity both between and within intervention types, and the networks were sparse across all outcomes. At the end of treatment, behavioural interventions showed some beneficial effects when compared with usual care, in particular for improvement of specific physical symptoms [(1) pain: high-intensity cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBTHI) standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.54 [95% credible interval (CrI) 0.28 to 0.84], multimodal SMD 0.52 (95% CrI 0.19 to 0.89); and (2) fatigue: low-intensity cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBTLI) SMD 0.72 (95% CrI 0.27 to 1.21), relaxation/stretching/social support/emotional support SMD 0.87 (95% CrI 0.20 to 1.55), graded activity SMD 0.51 (95% CrI 0.14 to 0.93), multimodal SMD 0.52 (95% CrI 0.14 to 0.92)] and psychological outcomes [(1) anxiety CBTHI SMD 0.52 (95% CrI 0.06 to 0.96); (2) depression CBTHI SMD 0.80 (95% CrI 0.26 to 1.38); and (3) emotional distress other psychotherapy SMD 0.58 (95% CrI 0.05 to 1.13), relaxation/stretching/social support/emotional support SMD 0.66 (95% CrI 0.18 to 1.28) and sport/exercise SMD 0.49 (95% CrI 0.03 to 1.01)]. At short-term follow-up, behavioural interventions showed some beneficial effects for specific physical symptoms [(1) pain: CBTHI SMD 0.73 (95% CrI 0.10 to 1.39); (2) fatigue: CBTLI SMD 0.62 (95% CrI 0.11 to 1.14), relaxation/stretching/social support/emotional support SMD 0.51 (95% CrI 0.06 to 1.00)] and psychological outcomes [(1) anxiety: CBTHI SMD 0.74 (95% CrI 0.14 to 1.34); (2) depression: CBTHI SMD 0.93 (95% CrI 0.37 to 1.52); and (3) emotional distress: relaxation/stretching/social support/emotional support SMD 0.82 (95% CrI 0.02 to 1.65), multimodal SMD 0.43 (95% CrI 0.04 to 0.91)]. For physical functioning, only multimodal therapy showed beneficial effects: end-of-treatment SMD 0.33 (95% CrI 0.09 to 0.59); and short-term follow-up SMD 0.78 (95% CrI 0.23 to 1.40). For impact on daily activities, CBTHI was the only behavioural intervention to show beneficial effects [end-of-treatment SMD 1.30 (95% CrI 0.59 to 2.00); and short-term follow-up SMD 2.25 (95% CrI 1.34 to 3.16)]. Few effects remained at long-term follow-up. General practitioner interventions showed no significant beneficial effects for any outcome. No intervention group showed conclusive beneficial effects for measures of symptom load (somatisation). A large degree of heterogeneity was found across individual studies in the assessment of cost-effectiveness. Several studies suggested that the interventions produce fewer quality-adjusted life-years than usual care. For those interventions that generated quality-adjusted life-year gains, the mid-point incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from 1397 to 129,267, but, where the mid-point ICER fell below 30,000, the exploratory assessment of uncertainty suggested that it may be above 30,000.
<b>LIMITATIONS</b>: Sparse networks meant that it was not possible to conduct a metaregression to explain between-study differences in effects. Results were not consistent within intervention type, and there were considerable differences in characteristics between studies of the same type. There were moderate to high levels of statistical heterogeneity. Separate analyses were conducted for three time points and, therefore, analyses are not repeated-measures analyses and do not account for correlations between time points.
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Behavioural interventions showed some beneficial effects for specific medically unexplained symptoms, but no one behavioural intervention was effective across all medically unexplained symptoms. There was little evidence that these interventions are effective for measures of symptom load (somatisation). General practitioner-led interventions were not shown to be effective. Considerable heterogeneity in interventions, populations and sparse networks mean that results should be interpreted with caution. The relationship between patient and service provider is perceived to play a key role in facilitating a successful intervention. Future research should focus on testing the therapeutic effects of the general practitioner-patient relationship within trials of behavioural interventions, and explaining the observed between-study differences in effects within the same intervention type (e.g. with more detailed reporting of defined mechanisms of the interventions under study).

J3595,2022,Impact of video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy versus open lobectomy for lung cancer on recovery assessed using self-reported physical function: VIOLET RCT,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Surgery remains the main method of managing early-stage disease. Minimal-access video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery results in less tissue trauma than open surgery; however, it is not known if it improves patient outcomes.
<b>OBJECTIVE</b>: To compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy with open surgery for the treatment of lung cancer.
<b>DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS</b>: A multicentre, superiority, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial with blinding of participants (until hospital discharge) and outcome assessors conducted in nine NHS hospitals. Adults referred for lung resection for known or suspected lung cancer, with disease suitable for both surgeries, were eligible. Participants were followed up for 1 year.
<b>INTERVENTIONS</b>: Participants were randomised 1 : 1 to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy or open surgery. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery used one to four keyhole incisions without rib spreading. Open surgery used a single incision with rib spreading, with or without rib resection.
<b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</b>: The primary outcome was self-reported physical function (using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30) at 5 weeks. Secondary outcomes included upstaging to pathologic node stage 2 disease, time from surgery to hospital discharge, pain in the first 2 days, prolonged pain requiring analgesia at > 5 weeks, adverse health events, uptake of adjuvant treatment, overall and disease-free survival, quality of life (Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30, Quality of Life Questionnaire Lung Cancer 13 and EQ-5D) at 2 and 5 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months, and cost-effectiveness.
<b>RESULTS</b>: A total of 503 patients were randomised between July 2015 and February 2019 (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, n = 247; open surgery, n = 256). One participant withdrew before surgery. The mean age of patients was 69 years; 249 (49.5%) patients were men and 242 (48.1%) did not have a confirmed diagnosis. Lobectomy was performed in 453 of 502 (90.2%) participants and complete resection was achieved in 429 of 439 (97.7%) participants. Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 physical function was better in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group than in the open-surgery group at 5 weeks (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, n = 247; open surgery, n = 255; mean difference 4.65, 95% confidence interval 1.69 to 7.61; p = 0.0089). Upstaging from clinical node stage 0 to pathologic node stage 1 and from clinical node stage 0 or 1 to pathologic node stage 2 was similar (p >= 0.50). Pain scores were similar on day 1, but lower in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group on day 2 (mean difference -0.54, 95% confidence interval -0.99 to -0.09; p = 0.018). Analgesic consumption was 10% lower (95% CI -20% to 1%) and the median hospital stay was less (4 vs. 5 days, hazard ratio 1.34, 95% confidence interval 1.09, 1.65; p = 0.006) in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group than in the open-surgery group. Prolonged pain was also less (relative risk 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.003). Time to uptake of adjuvant treatment, overall survival and progression-free survival were similar (p >= 0.28). Fewer participants in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group than in the open-surgery group experienced complications before and after discharge from hospital (relative risk 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.84; p < 0.001 and relative risk 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.00; p = 0.053, respectively). Quality of life to 1 year was better across several domains in the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group than in the open-surgery group. The probability that video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year is 1.
<b>LIMITATIONS</b>: Ethnic minorities were under-represented compared with the UK population (< 5%), but the cohort reflected the lung cancer population.
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy was associated with less pain, fewer complications and better quality of life without any compromise to oncologic outcome. Use of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is highly likely to be cost-effective for the NHS.
<b>FUTURE WORK</b>: Evaluation of the efficacy of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with robotic assistance, which is being offered in many hospitals.

J3599,2022,A psychological intervention by community pharmacies to prevent depression in adults with subthreshold depression and long-term conditions: the CHEMIST pilot RCT,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: Depression is common in people with long-term health conditions, and this combination can lead to worsened health outcomes and increased health-care costs. Subthreshold depression, a risk factor for major depression, is prevalent in this population, but many people remain untreated due to the demand on services. The community pharmacy may be an alternative setting to offer mental health support; however, insufficient evidence exists to support implementation.
<b>OBJECTIVES</b>: To conduct a feasibility study and pilot randomised controlled trial of a community pharmacy-delivered psychological intervention aimed at preventing depression in adults with long-term health conditions.
<b>DESIGN</b>: A feasibility study with nested qualitative evaluation and an external pilot, two-arm, 1 : 1 individually randomised controlled trial with nested process and economic evaluations.
<b>SETTING</b>: Community pharmacies in the north of England.
<b>PARTICIPANTS</b>: Adults aged >= 18 years with subthreshold depression and at least one long-term health condition.
<b>INTERVENTION</b>: A bespoke enhanced support intervention (behavioural activation within a collaborative care framework) involving up to six sessions delivered by trained community pharmacy staff (intervention facilitators) compared with usual care.
<b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</b>: Recruitment and retention rates, completeness of outcome measures and intervention engagement. The intended primary outcome was depression severity at 4 months, assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9.
<b>RESULTS</b>: In the feasibility study, 24 participants were recruited. Outcome measure completeness was 95-100%. Retention at 4 months was 83%. Seventeen participants (71%) commenced intervention sessions and all completed two or more sessions. Depression symptoms reduced slightly at 4 months. The process evaluation suggested that the intervention was acceptable to participants and intervention facilitators. In the pilot randomised controlled trial, 44 participants (target of 100 participants) were randomised (intervention, n = 24; usual care, n = 20). Outcome measure completeness was 100%. Retention at 4 months was 93%. Eighteen participants (75%) commenced intervention sessions and 16 completed two or more sessions. Depression symptoms reduced slightly at 4 months, with a slightly larger reduction in the usual-care arm, although the small sample size limits any conclusions. The process evaluation reported good acceptability of the intervention and identified barriers associated with study implementation and its impact on core pharmacy functions. The economic analysis revealed some indication of reduced resource use/costs associated with the intervention, but this is limited by the small sample size. Intervention costs were low.
<b>LIMITATIONS</b>: The main limitation is the small sample size due to difficulties with recruitment and barriers to implementing the study within existing pharmacy practices.
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: The community pharmacy represents a new setting to deliver a depression prevention intervention. Recruitment was a challenge and pharmacy staff encountered barriers to effective implementation of the study within busy pharmacy practice. Despite these challenges, good retention rates and intervention engagement were demonstrated, and process evaluation suggested that the intervention was acceptable in this setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that community pharmacy staff can be trained to deliver a depression prevention intervention.
<b>FUTURE WORK</b>: Further work is needed to address barriers to recruitment, intervention delivery and implementation of psychological interventions in the community pharmacy setting.

J3605,2022,Interventions for the eradication of meticillinÃ¢â‚¬Âresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in people with cystic fibrosis,"- Background Cystic fibrosis is an inherited recessive disorder of chloride transport that is characterised by recurrent and persistent pulmonary infections from resistant organisms that result in lung function deterioration and early mortality in sufferers. MeticillinÃ¢â‚¬Âresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged not only as an important infection in people who are hospitalised, but also as a potentially harmful pathogen in cystic fibrosis. Chronic pulmonary infection with MRSA is thought to confer on people with cystic fibrosis a worse clinical outcome and result in an increased rate of lung function decline. Clear guidance for MRSA eradication in cystic fibrosis, supported by robust evidence, is urgently needed. This is an update of a previous review. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment regimens designed to eradicate MRSA and to determine whether the eradication of MRSA confers better clinical and microbiological outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. To ascertain whether attempts at eradicating MRSA can lead to increased acquisition of other resistant organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa ), increased adverse effects from drugs, or both. Search methods We identified randomised and quasiÃ¢â‚¬Ârandomised controlled trials by searching the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders (CFGD) Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, PubMed, MEDLINE and three clinical trials registries; by handsearching article reference lists; and through contact with experts in the field. We last searched the CFGD Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 4 October 2021, and the ongoing trials registries on 31 January 2022. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasiÃ¢â‚¬ÂRCTs of any combinations of topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous antimicrobials primarily aimed at eradicating MRSA compared with placebo, standard treatment or no treatment. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and used the GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results The review includes three RCTs with 135 participants with MRSA infection. Two trials compared active treatment versus observation only and one trial compared active treatment with placebo. Active treatment versus observation In both trials (106 participants), active treatment consisted of oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin. One trial administered this combination for two weeks alongside nasal, skin and oral decontamination and a threeÃ¢â‚¬Âweek environmental decontamination, while the second trial administered this drug combination for 21 days with five days intranasal mupirocin. Both trials reported successful eradication of MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis, but they used different definitions of eradication. One trial (45 participants) defined MRSA eradication as negative MRSA respiratory cultures at day 28, and reported that oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin may lead to a higher proportion of negative cultures compared to control (odds ratio (OR) 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.84 to 55.84; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). However, by day 168 of followÃ¢â‚¬Âup, there was no difference between groups in the proportion of participants who remained MRSAÃ¢â‚¬Ânegative (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.42; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The second trial defined successful eradication as the absence of MRSA following treatment in at least three cultures over a period of six months. We are uncertain if the intervention led to results favouring the treatment group as the certainty of the evidence was very low (OR 2.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 11.75). There were no differences between groups in the remaining outcomes for this comparison: quality of life, frequency of exacerbations or adverse effects (all lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) or the change from baseline in lung function or weight (both very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The time until next positive MRSA isolate was not reported. The included trials found no differences between groups in terms of nasal colonisation with MRSA. While not a specific outcome of this review, investigators from one study reported that the rate of hospitalisation from screening through day 168 was lower with oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin compared to control (rate ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.72; P = 0.01). Nebulised vancomycin with oral antibiotics versus nebulised placebo with oral antibiotics The third trial (29 participants) defined eradication as a negative respiratory sample for MRSA at one month following completion of treatment. No differences were reported in MRSA eradication between treatment arms (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.39; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). No differences between groups were seen in lung function or adverse effects (lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence), in quality of life (very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence) or nasal colonisation with MRSA. The trial did not report on the change in weight or frequency of exacerbations. Authors' conclusions Early eradication of MRSA is possible in people with cystic fibrosis, with one trial demonstrating superiority of active MRSA treatment compared with observation only in terms of the proportion of MRSAÃ¢â‚¬Ânegative respiratory cultures at day 28. However, followÃ¢â‚¬Âup at three or six months showed no difference between treatment and control in the proportion of participants remaining MRSAÃ¢â‚¬Ânegative. Moreover, the longerÃ¢â‚¬Âterm clinical consequences Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in terms of lung function, mortality and cost of care Ã¢â‚¬â€œ remain unclear. Using GRADE methodology, we judged the certainty of the evidence provided by this review to be very low to low, due to potential biases from the openÃ¢â‚¬Âlabel design, high rates of attrition and small sample sizes. Based on the available evidence, we believe that whilst early eradication of respiratory MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis is possible, there is not currently enough evidence regarding the clinical outcomes of eradication to support the use of the interventions studied. Plain language summary Treatments to clear the 'superbug' meticillinÃ¢â‚¬Âresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis Review question We looked for evidence for the effects of different ways of clearing meticillinÃ¢â‚¬Âresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a soÃ¢â‚¬Âcalled 'superbug', from the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. Background MRSA is a type of bacteria resistant to some types of antibiotics (medicines that kill or inhibit bacteria). Because MRSA is hard to treat, it is sometimes called a 'superbug'. Infection with MRSA is particularly worrying for people with cystic fibrosis, an inherited condition which, amongst other things, causes thick mucus to build up in the lungs. It is very difficult for people with cystic fibrosis to cough up this thick mucus, making it an ideal breeding ground for bacteria, including MRSA, and making these people more prone to chest infections. It is thought that MRSA can cause more damage than other bacteria which are not resistant to antibiotics. We wanted to identify research evidence to support the best way for treating MRSA infections and also to see if this treatment would improve the lives of people with cystic fibrosis. This is an update of a previously published review. Search date The evidence is current to 31 January 2022. Key results We found three studies which included 135 people with cystic fibrosis and a diagnosed MRSA infection. Two studies (106 people) compared treatment given to one group of people versus observation only of a second group of people. In one of these studies, people in the active treatment group were given oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin (all three are antibiotic medicines), plus additional decontamination treatment. In the second trial, people in the active treatment group were given two antibiotics orally (coÃ¢â‚¬Âtrimoxazole and rifampicin) and one by nose spray (mupirocin). The results of these studies showed that clearing MRSA from the airways of people with cystic fibrosis is possible. In both tr als, a larger proportion of those who were treated cleared MRSA. However, some people who were untreated also cleared MRSA spontaneously. Also, six months after treatment, the number of individuals who still had MRSA was not different between those who had received treatment and those who had not. We found no differences between treatment groups in quality of life, frequency of exacerbations (that is, flareÃ¢â‚¬Âups of the disease), unwanted or harmful effects of treatment, nasal colonisation with MRSA, or in changes in lung function or weight. The studies did not report the length of time until finding the next positive MRSA result in participants. In one of the studies, fewer people who were treated with antibiotics were admitted to hospital in the first 168 days. The third study compared treatment groups who were given either an inhaled antibiotic or an inhaled placebo (inactive substance). Both groups were also given the same oral antibiotics. In this study, there was no difference between groups in MRSA clearance. There were no differences between groups in lung function, quality of life, unwanted or harmful effects or nasal colonisation with MRSA. The trial did not report on change in weight or frequency of exacerbations. Treating MRSA early in people with cystic fibrosis has been shown to be possible, but it is not clear what longerÃ¢â‚¬Âterm implications this treatment will have. Main limitations of the evidence We had little or no confidence in the evidence we found for the different outcomes. This was due to potential issues from the study designs, where people knew which treatment each participant was receiving (groups were either given medication or just observed), and because there were small numbers of people in each study.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,MRSA treatment in cystic fibrosis implies hospital or community health setting.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article in a reputable journal,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,RCTs with placebo/control and clinical outcomes.,TRUE,Placebo,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety', 'pro']",0.95
J3606,2022,A multidomain decision support tool to prevent falls in older people: the FinCH cluster RCT,"Background: Falls in care home residents are common, unpleasant, costly and difficult to prevent. Objective(s): The objectives were to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Guide to Action for falls prevention in Care Homes (GtACH) programme. Design(s): A multicentre, cluster, parallel, 1: 1 randomised controlled trial with embedded process evaluation and economic evaluation. Care homes were randomised on a 1: 1 basis to the GtACH programme or usual care using a secure web-based randomisation service. Research assistants, participating residents and staff informants were blind to allocation at recruitment; research assistants were blind to allocation at follow-up. NHS Digital data were extracted blindly. Setting(s): Older people's care homes from 10 UK sites. Participant(s): Older care home residents. Intervention(s): The GtACH programme, which includes care home staff training, systematic use of a multidomain decision support tool and implementation of falls prevention actions, compared to usual falls prevention care. Outcome(s): The primary trial outcome was the rate of falls per participating resident occurring during the 90-day period between 91 and 180 days post randomisation. The primary outcome for the cost-effectiveness analysis was the cost per fall averted, and the primary outcome for the cost-utility analysis was the incremental cost per quality adjusted life-year. Secondary outcomes included the rate of falls over days 0-90 and 181-360 post randomisation, activity levels, dependency and fractures. The number of falls per resident was compared between arms using a negative binomial regression model (generalised estimating equation). Result(s): A total of 84 care homes were randomised: 39 to the GtACH arm and 45 to the control arm. A total of 1657 residents consented and provided baseline measures (mean age 85 years, 32% men). GtACH programme training was delivered to 1051 staff (71% of eligible staff) over 146 group sessions. Primary outcome data were available for 630 GtACH participants and 712 control participants. The primary outcome result showed an unadjusted incidence rate ratio of 0.57 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.71; p < 0.01) in favour of the GtACH programme. Falls rates were lower in the GtACH arm in the period 0-90 days. There were no other differences between arms in the secondary outcomes. Care home staff valued the training, systematic strategies and specialist peer support, but the incorporation of the GtACH programme documentation into routine care home practice was limited. No adverse events were recorded. The incremental cost was 20,889.42 per Dementia Specific Quality of Life-based quality-adjusted life-year and 4543.69 per quality-adjusted life-year based on the EuroQol-5 dimensions, five-level version. The mean number of falls was 1.889 (standard deviation 3.662) in the GtACH arm and 2.747 (standard deviation 7.414) in the control arm. Therefore, 0.858 falls were averted. The base-case incremental cost per fall averted was 190.62. Conclusion(s): The GtACH programme significantly reduced the falls rate in the study care homes without restricting residents' activity levels or increasing their dependency, and was cost-effective at current thresholds in the NHS.

J3608,2022,HTA186 Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Tirbanibulin for the Treatment of Actinic Keratosis From a Scottish NHS Perspective,"Objectives: Actinic keratosis is a chronic skin condition that may cause pain, itch and bleeding. It may also develop into squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. Many of the active topical interventions are associated with substantial adverse event rates and/or require relatively long treatment courses. Tirbanibulin 1% is a recently launched 5-day course topical treatment for the face and scalp. Results of two phase III clinical trials indicate that tirbanibulin leads to significant improvements in the complete clearance of actinic keratosis lesions at 57 days (vs placebo). The aim was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of tirbanibulin, compared to the three most common topical therapies, from a Scottish perspective. Method(s): A one-year decision tree model was developed to compare tirbanibulin with diclofenac sodium gel 3%, imiquimod cream 5%, and fluorouracil cream 5%. Patients were separated into two categories: successful and unsuccessful. Treatment was 'successful' if no clinically visible lesions remained at the end of the treatment period. The probability of complete clearance associated with each treatment was informed from a network meta-analysis. The probability of treatment-related adverse events (in the form of severe local skin reactions) were informed from a targeted literature search. The model captured direct medical costs associated with treatment acquisition, treatment-related adverse events and healthcare professional visits. Disutilities associated with actinic keratosis and local skin reactions were also captured. Result(s): Over a one-year time horizon tirbanibulin led to cost savings of 31.35, 76,16 and 92.84 versus diclofenac, imiquimod, and fluorouracil respectively. Additionally, tirbanibulin was dominant, as it was associated with negligibly higher quality-adjusted life years of approximately 0.005. Tirbanibulin also remained cost saving when model inputs were varied in sensitivity and scenario analyses. Conclusion(s): Tirbanibulin is cost-saving and cost-effective for the treatment of actinic keratosis in Scotland when compared with the most commonly used topical therapies.

J3609,2022,Heparin versus 0.9% sodium chloride locking for prevention of occlusion in central venous catheters in adults,"- Background Intermittent locking of central venous catheters (CVCs) is undertaken to help maintain their patency and performance. There are systematic variations in care: some practitioners use heparin (at different concentrations), whilst others use 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline). This review looks at the effectiveness and safety of intermittent locking with heparin compared to normal saline, to see if the evidence establishes whether one is better than the other. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of intermittent locking of CVCs with heparin versus normal saline in adults to prevent occlusion. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 20 October 2021. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials in adults Ã¢â€°Â¥ 18 years of age with a CVC that compared intermittent locking with heparin at any concentration versus normal saline. We excluded studies on infants and children from this review. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were occlusion of CVCs and duration of catheter patency. Our secondary outcomes were CVCÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated bloodstream infections and CVCÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated colonisation, mortality, haemorrhage, heparinÃ¢â‚¬Âinduced thrombocytopaenia, CVCÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated thrombosis, number of additional CVC insertions, abnormality of coagulation profile and allergic reactions to heparin. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results We identified one new RCT with 30 participants for this update. We included a total of 12 RCTs with 2422 participants. Data for metaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalysis were available from all RCTs. We noted differences in methods used by the included studies and variation in heparin concentrations (10 to 5000 IU/mL), time to followÃ¢â‚¬Âup (1 to 251.8 days), and the unit of analysis used (participant, catheter, line access). Five studies included ICU (intensive care unit) patients, two studies included oncology patients, and the remaining studies included miscellaneous patients (chronic kidney disease, haemodialysis, home care patients, etc.). Primary outcomes Overall, combined results may show fewer occlusions with heparin compared to normal saline but this is uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.95; 10 studies; 1672 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). We pooled studies that used participant or catheter as the unit of analysis. We carried out subgroup analysis by unit of analysis. No clear differences were detected after testing for subgroup differences (P = 0.23). We found no clear evidence of a difference in the duration of catheter patency with heparin compared to normal saline (mean difference (MD) 0.44 days, 95% CI Ã¢â‚¬Â0.10 to 0.99; 6 studies; 1788 participants; lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). Secondary outcomes We found no clear evidence of a difference in the following outcomes: CVCÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated bloodstream infections (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.80; 3 studies; 1127 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); mortality (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.31; 3 studies; 1100 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); haemorrhage (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 5.74; 3 studies; 1197 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence); or heparinÃ¢â‚¬Âinduced thrombocytopaenia (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.27; 3 studies; 443 participants; very lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence). The main reasons for downgrading the certainty of evidence for the primary and secondary outcomes were unclear allocation concealment, suspicion of publication bias, imprecision and inconsistency. Authors' conclusions Given the lowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence, we are uncertain whether intermittent locking with heparin results in fewer central venous catheter occlusions than intermittent locking with normal saline in adults. LowÃ¢â‚¬Âcertainty evidence suggests that heparin may have little or no effect on catheter patency duration. Although we found no evidence of differences in safety (CVCÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated bloodstream infections, mortality, or haemorrha e), the combined studies were not powered to detect rare adverse events such as heparinÃ¢â‚¬Âinduced thrombocytopaenia. Further research conducted over longer periods would reduce the current uncertainties. Plain language summary Does heparin locking prevent blocking of central venous catheters in adults when compared to locking with normal saline? Key message We did not find clear evidence of a difference between heparin and normal saline solution (sterile solution of salt in water) in preventing central venous catheter blockages (occlusions), or in the length of time catheters remained unblocked, or in the number of side effects such as infections, death, bleeding, etc. Further wellÃ¢â‚¬Âdesigned, largeÃ¢â‚¬Âscale studies are required to reduce uncertainties. Why is this question important? Central venous catheters are tubes (also called 'lines') that must be temporarily placed into the veins of patients whose veins need to be accessed regularly for medical reasons. These are inserted into the great vessels leading to the heart. While not in use, a fluid is injected into the catheter until it is next used to avoid blood clots that can block the catheter. This is called locking catheters. Replacement of catheters adds to the cost of care, may delay treatment, and poses an additional risk of catheterÃ¢â‚¬Ârelated adverse events to the patient. The catheter may also become infected, resulting in bloodstream infections. Fluids used for locking are heparin or normal saline. Heparin, which is an anticoagulant, is used to prevent clotting of the blood. It may also help to prevent the catheters from blocking; however, it can also cause bleeding, allergic reactions, and a drop in the number of platelets in the blood. This has raised the question whether heparin is better than saline to avoid blockages, and how safe each method is. What did we do? We searched for randomised controlled trials that assessed whether locking catheters with heparin was more effective in reducing the risk of blocking and infections compared to normal saline. In randomised controlled trials, the treatments people receive are decided at random and these give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects. What we did find? We found one new study for this update. In total, we included 12 studies with 2422 people. Five studies included ICU patients, two studies included cancer patients, and the remaining studies included miscellaneous patients (haemodialysis, home care patients, etc.). We cannot conclude that locking catheters with heparin prevents blocking better than flushing with normal saline. We saw little or no difference in the length of time the catheter remained unblocked or in the numbers of side effects between heparin or saline use. How certain are we with the evidence? When comparing heparin with saline, the certainty of the evidence of the results ranged from very low to low due to the design of the studies and because the overall result included the likelihood of both benefit and harm. How up to date is the evidence? This Cochrane review updates our previous evidence.

J3610,2022,Predicting the cost impact of dose individualisation associated with pharmacogenetic testing to avoid adverse drug reactions in a specialist cancer centre - a methodological template,"Introduction: Pre-emptive pharmacogenetic testing can help minimise adverse drug reactions (ADRs) however most economic evaluations exploring its cost-effectiveness are based on single-pharmacogene testing.1,2 Currently, there is no nationally established multi-gene panel testing for ADR gene-drug pairs to guide dose individualisation, mainly due to lack of robust economic evidence.3 Economic modelling frameworks require detailed considerations of all the eventualities in health outcomes to fully assess the impact of implementing pharmacogenetic testing in avoiding ADRs.4 The relevance of such framework is dependent on the perspective of the policymakers, particularly when full economic evaluation is not feasible or when decision-making process only requires information pertaining to the short-term cost impact of implementing a new healthcare intervention. Objectives * To assess the cost impact associated with dose individualisation based on acting upon result findings of pharmacogenetic panel testing in a specialist cancer centre. * To evaluate the range in cost impact and identify contributing factors to consider when prioritising drug-gene pairs for panel testing. Methods * Identify dispensing data for clinically actionable (Level A evidence) drug-gene pairs from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) between April 2019 - April 2020. [5] Clinical trials prescriptions were excluded. * Calculate the total expenditure spent on the studied population based on mean prescribed dose for each drug using costs from British National Formulary (BNF). [6] * Calculate the total expenditure after implementing dose individualisation in affected population based on population prevalence of the gene-drug pair variants and CPIC prescribing guidelines. [5] * Compare cost difference between total expenditures before and after adjusting for genetic findings. Results/Key findings: Between April 2019 and 2020, a total of 8173 patients (68,200 prescriptions) were prescribed with one of the eleven drugs identified (Table 1). Evaluation of cost savings through geneticbased dose individualisation was between 114,938 to 452,190 (3.34 to 14.33 per prescription); exclusive of the cost of testing. Majority of orally administered drugs have negligible cost impact, except for voriconazole which, despite only prescribed in 23 patients, has the highest cost impact. When using the highest cost per drug unit, there were significant increases in the cost impact for amitriptyline (from 138 to 45,653), fluorouracil (from 2234 to 47,027), irinotecan (from 29,205 to 129,916), and tamoxifen (from 1798 to 24,452). As the cost of ADR pharmacogenes panel-test remains unknown, this study predicted that the maximum cost of such test can vary between 14.06 to 55.33 per patient. To ensure dose individualisation remains costsaving, restricting testing to selected patient groups where the projected cost-savings are lower than the cost of test for 70% of patients is recommended. Limitation(s): This study assumed that dose individualisation was acted upon existing genetic findings. Study also assumed that dose individualisation results in total ADR avoidance. The cost saving from ADR avoidance is not included. Study only reviewed population prevalence data from Caucasian ethnicity. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that genetic-based dose individualisation can be cost-saving and have considerable cost impact for certain drugs. It also highlighted key factors to consider when prioritising drug-gene pairs for panel testing integration.

J3613,2022,CREATION of A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM (MDT) RHEUMATOLOGY CLINIC at UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON HOSPITAL (UCLH) to TACKLE the BACKLOG of PATIENTS WAITING for TREATMENT AS A RESULT of the COVID-19 PANDEMIC,"Background: Covid-19 has consumed hospital resources since January 2020. In the UK, routine care has been disrupted with an estimated 30 million fewer outpatient attendances (2020/21) and over 6 million patients waiting for consultant led care (1). The British Society for Rheumatology 'Rheumatology Workforce: a crisis in numbers (2021)' highlights the challenges facing National Health Service rheumatology departments in managing rising caseloads (2). In 2021, UCLH wait time for follow up rheumatology appointments was 9 months. We were inundated with patients requiring urgent treatment. Innovative ways of running outpatients were required which led to the formation of an MDT clinic. Objective(s): Create a Rheumatology MDT clinic to: Reduce follow up time Increase clinic capacity Reduce number of hospital attendances Add value to each clinic encounter Methods: The consultant lead identifed an existing clinical nurse specialist (CNS) interested in supporting the MDT. With a UCLH Outpatient Transformation grant of 15,000 we recruited an advanced physiotherapy practitioner (APP) and administrator for a 6 month trial period. Managerial support was provided by the board. We met weekly to agree aims and allocate responsibilities. We did the following: Reviewed clinic lists for 6 months to identify duplicate appointments. Identifed patients with CNS and consultant follow up scheduled in a short time frame and cancelled unnecessary appointments. Reviewed the clinic list weekly to identify patients suitable for APP management. This allowed overbooking of urgent cases. Embedded hand ultrasound appointments in the clinic template. Created CNS 'Zoom' virtual drop-ins for routine enquiries to reduce the administrative burden of patient emails/phone calls occurring outside the clinic. Organised patient participation sessions to help shape the service and collected patient feedback questionnaires. Result(s): We reduced our waiting time for follow up appointments from 9 months to 2 months. Pre-MDT the average wait from consultant referral to physiotherapist appointment was 55 days. The MDT allows for same day assessment (reducing 2-3 patient journeys a clinic) and where suitable, facilitates discharge or onwards referral to the appropriate service i.e. pain management, hand therapy, APP-led hypermobility programme. A dedicated MDT CNS has shortened treatment times, reduced email traffic between CNS and consultant and allows for same day, joint decision making resulting in fewer appointments. Patients welcomed the Zoom sessions as an efficient, reliable method of raising concerns/queries. Our administrator helps to facilitate communication between patients and clinicians and streamline MDT processes. Embedding point of care ultrasound reduces hospital visits and enhances treatment decision making thereby reducing follow up attendances. Conclusion(s): Our MDT model has reduced waiting lists, decreased treatment delays and cut the number of hospital visits. Performing ultrasound in clinic helped prevent patients being sent for scans at private providers. This cost saving likely covers the APP, ensuring the project is close to cost neutral. Shared decision making added value to outpatient attendances, refected in patients positive feedback. The MDT enhances the role of APP and CNS, utilising their unique skill set. Administrative support is crucial, enhances team working and places added value on this often underappreciated role. We encourage other Rheumatology departments to adopt an MDT approach to tackle the backlog of patients awaiting treatment, add value to clinic encounters and maximise the skill set of clinicians involved in patient care.",TRUE,"Study conducted at University College London Hospital, UK",TRUE,Study occurs in NHS hospital setting.,TRUE,"Unclear publication type, flagged for review",Unknown,0.7,TRUE,Pre/post comparison with numeric deltas and outcomes on cost and impact.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['cost', 'time', 'utilization']",0.9
J3616,2022,Cost-utility analysis of robotic-assisted radical cystectomy for bladder cancer compared to open radical cystectomy in the United Kingdom,"Background Bladder cancer is the tenth most common cancer in the United Kingdom. Currently, open radical cystectomy (ORC) is the gold standard. Due to the risk of complications and a 2.3-8% mortality rate1, there is growing interest in the use of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC). The aim of this study is to perform a cost-utility analysis, comparing RARC to ORC for bladder cancer patients from the perspective of the National Health Service England. Methods A three-stage decision tree: surgery, post-surgery transfusions and complications, in a 90-day time horizon, was produced to simulate possible pathways of patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated based on data derived from current literature. Multiple univariate sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate influences of varying costs of RARC and ORC on the ICER. Results The ICER for RARC compared to ORC resulted in 25,536/QALY. At the lower threshold of 20,000/QALY, RARC resulted in a negative NMB (-4,843.32) and at the upper threshold of 30,000/QALY, a positive NMB (624.61) compared to ORC. Threshold analysis showed that the intervention costs of 13,497 and 14,403 are met at the lower and upper threshold respectively. The univariate sensitivity analysis showed that the intervention costs of RARC or ORC, and the probabilities of complications, had the greatest impact on the ICER. Conclusion As the resultant ICER did not fall below the 20,000/QALY threshold, our study did not provide a definitive recommendation for RARC for bladder cancer. Negative values for the NMB at the lower threshold indicated the intervention was not feasible from a cost perspective. At the upper threshold of 30,000/QALY, this situation was reversed. The intervention became cost-effective. Therefore, further research is needed to justify the intervention. Copyright Ã‚Â© 2022 Machleid et al.

<b>DESIGN</b>: This was a pragmatic, multicentre, two-arm, parallel-group, non-blinded, randomised controlled trial.
<b>SETTING</b>: Eighteen in vitro fertilisation clinics across the UK participated from February 2016 to April 2019.
<b>PARTICIPANTS</b>: Couples undergoing their first, second or third cycle of in vitro fertilisation treatment in which the female partner was aged < 42 years.
<b>INTERVENTIONS</b>: If at least three good-quality embryos were present on day 3 of embryo development, couples were randomly allocated to either freeze-all (intervention) or fresh-embryo transfer (control).
<b>OUTCOMES</b>: The primary outcome was a healthy baby, defined as a live, singleton baby born at term, with an appropriate weight for their gestation. Secondary outcomes included ovarian hyperstimulation, live birth and clinical pregnancy rates, complications of pregnancy and childbirth, health economic outcome, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scores.
<b>RESULTS</b>: A total of 1578 couples were consented and 619 couples were randomised. Most non-randomisations were because of the non-availability of at least three good-quality embryos (n = 476). Of the couples randomised, 117 (19%) did not adhere to the allocated intervention. The rate of non-adherence was higher in the freeze-all arm, with the leading reason being patient choice. The intention-to-treat analysis showed a healthy baby rate of 20.3% in the freeze-all arm and 24.4% in the fresh-embryo transfer arm (risk ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 1.15). Similar results were obtained using complier-average causal effect analysis (risk ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.10), per-protocol analysis (risk ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.26) and as-treated analysis (risk ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.29). The risk of ovarian hyperstimulation was 3.6% in the freeze-all arm and 8.1% in the fresh-embryo transfer arm (risk ratio 0.44, 99% confidence interval 0.15 to 1.30). There were no statistically significant differences between the freeze-all and the fresh-embryo transfer arms in the live birth rates (28.3% vs. 34.3%; risk ratio 0.83, 99% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.06) and clinical pregnancy rates (33.9% vs. 40.1%; risk ratio 0.85, 99% confidence interval 0.65 to 1.11). There was no statistically significant difference in anxiety scores for male participants (mean difference 0.1, 99% confidence interval -2.4 to 2.6) and female participants (mean difference 0.0, 99% confidence interval -2.2 to 2.2) between the arms. The economic analysis showed that freeze-all had a low probability of being cost-effective in terms of the incremental cost per healthy baby and incremental cost per live birth.
<b>LIMITATIONS</b>: We were unable to reach the original planned sample size of 1086 and the rate of non-adherence to the allocated intervention was much higher than expected.
<b>CONCLUSION</b>: When efficacy, safety and costs are considered, freeze-all is not better than fresh-embryo transfer.
<b>TRIAL REGISTRATION</b>: This trial is registered as ISRCTN61225414.

J3624,2022,Cardiac implantable electronic device infections: prognostic value of the PADIT score and its cost-utility implications for antimicrobial envelope use in the United Kingdom,"Background: The incidence of cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infections is rising. Purpose(s): We examined the factors associated with CIED infection, assessed the prognostic power of the PADIT risk score, and modelled the cost-utility of selective TYRX antimicrobial envelope use for preventing CIED infections. Method(s): Data were extracted from 2016 to 2019, and included all de novo implants, generator changes and lead interventions for transvenous CIEDs at a high-volume UK centre. CIED infection was defined as hospitalisation for device infection within 12 months of a procedure. Cost-utility analysis was informed by standardised tariffs, and quality adjusted life year (QALY) and efficacy data was extrapolated from analysis of the WRAP-IT trial. Result(s): 6,035 patients underwent 7,383 procedures; CIED infection occurred in 59 individuals (0.8%). In addition to the constituents of the PA- DIT score, lead extraction (HR 3.3 (1.9-6.1), p<0.0001), C-reactive protein >50mg/l (HR 3.0 (1.4-6.4), p=0.005), re-intervention within two years (HR 10.1 (5.6-17.9), p<0.0001), and procedure duration over two hours (HR 2.6 (1.6-4.1), p=0.001) were independent predictors of infection. Increased PADIT score was strongly associated with infection (AUC: 0.82, HR per point increase: 1.36 (1.27-1.47), p<0.0001). A cost-utility model assigning TYRX envelopes to patients with PADIT scores >=6 predicted a reduction in infections (number needed to treat: 72) and a cost per QALY gained within the UK's (NICE) cost-effectiveness threshold (25,107). Conclusion(s): The PADIT score was a powerful predictor of CIED infections in a heterogeneous population,and may facilitate cost-effective TYRX envelope allocation in selected high-risk patients.

J3625,2022,A Social Return on Investment Evaluation of the Pilot Social Prescribing EmotionMind Dynamic Coaching Programme to Improve Mental Wellbeing and Self-Confidence,"The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to longer waiting lists for people seeking to access mental health services. The NHS Five Year Forward View encourages the development of empowerment-based social prescribing interventions to supplement existing mental health programmes. Based in South Wales, EmotionMind Dynamic (EMD) is a lifestyle coaching programme that supports individuals suffering from anxiety or depression. In this evaluation of lifestyle coaching, a mixed-method social return on investment (SROI) methodology was used to value quantitative and qualitative data from face-to-face and online participants. Data collection took place between June 2021 and January 2022. Participants included both self-referred clients and those referred from health services. Mental wellbeing data were collected at baseline and at the end of the programme using the short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS) and the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES). Baseline and follow-up data were available for 15 face-to-face participants and 17 online clients. Wellbeing valuation quantified and valued outcomes from participants. Results indicated that for every GBP 1 invested, lifestyle coaching generated social values ranging from GBP 4.12-GBP 7.08 for face-to-face clients compared with GBP 2.37-GBP 3.35 for online participants. Overall, lifestyle coaching generated positive social value ratios for both face-to-face and online clients.

J3630,2022,Probabilistic microsimulation to examine the cost-effectiveness of hospital admission screening strategies for carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in the United Kingdom,"Background: Antimicrobial resistance has been recognised as a global threat with carbapenemase- producing-Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) as a prime example. CPE has similarities to COVID-19 where asymptomatic patients may be colonised representing a source for onward transmission. There are limited treatment options for CPE infection leading to poor outcomes and increased costs. Admission screening can prevent cross-transmission by pre-emptively isolating colonised patients. Objective(s): We assess the relative cost-effectiveness of screening programmes compared with no- screening. Method(s): A microsimulation parameterised with NHS Scotland date was used to model scenarios of the prevalence of CPE colonised patients on admission. Screening strategies were (a) two-step screening involving a clinical risk assessment (CRA) checklist followed by microbiological testing of high-risk patients; and (b) universal screening. Strategies were considered with either culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. All costs were reported in 2019 UK pounds with a healthcare system perspective. Result(s): In the low prevalence scenario, no screening had the highest probability of cost-effectiveness. Among screening strategies, the two CRA screening options were the most likely to be cost-effective. Screening was more likely to be cost-effective than no screening in the prevalence of 1 CPE colonised in 500 admitted patients or more. There was substantial uncertainty with the probabilities rarely exceeding 40% and similar results between strategies. Screening reduced non-isolated bed-days and CPE colonisation. The cost of screening was low in relation to total costs. Conclusion(s): The specificity of the CRA checklist was the parameter with the highest impact on the cost-effectiveness. Further primary data collection is needed to build models with less uncertainty in the parameters.

J3637,2022,"The Payer License Agreement, or Netflix model,"" for hepatitis C virus therapies enables universal treatment access, lowers costs and incentivizes innovation and competition""","Background and Aims: High unit prices of treatments limit access. For epidemics like that of hepatitis C virus (HCV), reduced treatment access increases prevalence and incidence, making the infectious disease increasingly difficult to manage. The objective of the current study was to construct and test an alternative pricing model, the Payer License Agreement (PLA), and determine whether it could improve outcomes, cut costs and incentivize innovation versus the current unit-based pricing model. Method(s): We built and used computational models of hepatitis C disease progression, treatment, and pricing in historical and future scenarios and quantitatively analyzed their economic and epidemiological impact in three high-income countries. Result(s): This study had three key results regarding HCV treatment. First, if the PLA model had been implemented when interferon-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) combinations launched, the number of patients treated and cured would have more than doubled in the first three years, while the liver-related deaths (LRDs) would have decreased by around 40%. Second, if the PLA model had been implemented beginning in 2018, the year that several Netflix-like payment models were under implementation, the number of treated and cured patients would nearly double, and the LRDs would decline by more than 55%. Third, implementing the PLA model would result in a decline in total payer costs of more than 25%, with an increase to pharmaceutical manufacturer revenues of 10%. These results were true across the three healthcare landscapes studied, the USA, the UK and Italy, and were robust against variations to critical model parameters through sensitivity analysis. Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that implementation of the PLA model in high-income countries across a variety of health system contexts would improve patient outcomes at lower payer cost with more stable revenue for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Health policy-makers in high-income countries should consider the PLA model for application to more cost-effective management of HCV, and explore its application for other infectious diseases with curative therapies available now or soon.

J3638,2022,"Utility of PINP to monitor osteoporosis treatment in primary care, the POSE study (PINP and Osteoporosis in Sheffield Evaluation)","Purpose: In Sheffield (UK), we introduced the PINP monitoring algorithm for the management of osteoporosis treatment delivered in primary care. Our aims were to evaluate whether this algorithm was associated with better osteoporosis outcomes and was cost-effective compared to standard care. Method(s): Inclusion criteria were referral from Sheffield GPs, BMD scans performed between 2012 and 2013 and a report advising initiation of oral bisphosphonate and PINP monitoring. 906 patients were identified and retrospectively divided into Group A (intention to monitor, with baseline PINP, n = 588) and Group B (no intention to monitor, without baseline PINP, n = 318). The model described by Davis and colleagues was used to extrapolate life-time costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Result(s): No differences were found in baseline characteristics between groups (age, gender, BMI, BMD and major risk factors for fractures). More patients in Group A started oral treatment (77.4% vs 49.1%; p < 0.001), but there were no differences between groups in the presence of a gap in treatment >3 months or in treatment duration. Patients in Group A were more likely to have follow-up DXA scan at 4-6 years from baseline (46.9% vs 29.2%; p < 0.000) and had a greater increase in total hip BMD (+2.74% vs + 0.42%; p value = 0.003). Fewer new fractures occurred in Group A but this was not statistically significant, but the numbers of fractures were small. Patients in Group A were more likely to change management (p = 0.005) including switching to zoledronate (p = 0.03). The PINP measurement and increased prescribing in Group A resulted in increases in both costs (30.19) and QALYs (0.0039) relative to Group B, giving an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 7660 in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Conclusion(s): Patients monitored with PINP are more likely to start oral bisphosphonate treatment, switch to zoledronate, have follow-up DXA scans and a greater increase of hip BMD. PINP monitoring has the potential to be cost-effective in a UK NHS setting given that interventions with an ICER under 20,000 are generally considered to be cost-effective.

J3643,2022,Diagnostic test accuracy and costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness of tests for codeletion of chromosomal arms 1p and 19q in people with glioma,"- Background Complete deletion of both the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p) and the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q), known as 1p/19q codeletion, is a mutation that can occur in gliomas. It occurs in a type of glioma known as oligodendroglioma and its higher grade counterpart known as anaplastic oligodendroglioma. Detection of 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas is important because, together with another mutation in an enzyme known as isocitrate dehydrogenase, it is needed to make the diagnosis of an oligodendroglioma. Presence of 1p/19q codeletion also informs patient prognosis and prediction of the best drug treatment. The main two tests in use are fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)Ã¢â‚¬Âbased loss of heterozygosity (LOH) assays (also known as PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased short tandem repeat or microsatellite analysis). Many other tests are available. None of the tests is perfect, although PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH is expected to have very high sensitivity. Objectives To estimate the sensitivity and specificity and costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness of different deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)Ã¢â‚¬Âbased techniques for determining 1p/19q codeletion status in glioma. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase and BIOSIS up to July 2019. There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. We sought economic evaluation studies from the results of this search and using the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database. Selection criteria We included crossÃ¢â‚¬Âsectional studies in adults with glioma or any subtype of glioma, presenting raw data or crossÃ¢â‚¬Âtabulations of two or more DNAÃ¢â‚¬Âbased tests for 1p/19q codeletion. We also sought economic evaluations of these tests. Data collection and analysis We followed procedures outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Diagnostic Test Accuracy Reviews . Two review authors independently screened titles/abstracts/full texts, performed data extraction, and undertook applicability and risk of bias assessments using QUADASÃ¢â‚¬Â2. MetaÃ¢â‚¬Âanalyses used the hierarchical summary ROC model to estimate and compare test accuracy. We used FISH and PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH as alternate reference standards to examine how tests compared with those in common use, and conducted a latent class analysis comparing FISH and PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH. We constructed an economic model to evaluate costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffectiveness. Main results We included 53 studies examining: PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH, FISH, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, nextÃ¢â‚¬Âgeneration sequencing (NGS), comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH), array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH), multiplexÃ¢â‚¬ÂligationÃ¢â‚¬Âdependent probe amplification (MLPA), realÃ¢â‚¬Âtime PCR, chromogenic in situ hybridisation (CISH), mass spectrometry (MS), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, GÃ¢â‚¬Âbanding, methylation array and NanoString. Risk of bias was low for only one study; most gave us concerns about how patients were selected or about missing data. We had applicability concerns about many of the studies because only patients with specific subtypes of glioma were included. 1520 participants contributed to analyses using FISH as the reference, 1304 participants to analyses involving PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH as the reference and 262 participants to analyses of comparisons between methods from studies not including FISH or PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH. Most evidence was available for comparison of FISH with PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH (15 studies, 915 participants): PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH detected 94% of FISHÃ¢â‚¬Âdetermined codeletions (95% credible interval (CrI) 83% to 98%) and FISH detected 91% of codeletions determined by PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH (CrI 78% to 97%). Of tumours determined not to have a deletion by FISH, 94% (CrI 87% to 98%) had a deletion detected by PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH, and of those determined not to have a deletion by PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH, 96% (CrI 90% to 99%) had a deletion detected by FISH. The latent class analysis suggested that PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH may be slightly more accurate than FISH. Most other techniques appeared to have high sensitivity (i.e. produced few falseÃ¢â‚¬Ânegative resul s) for detection of 1p/19q codeletion when either FISH or PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH was considered as the reference standard, although there was limited evidence. There was some indication of differences in specificity (falseÃ¢â‚¬Âpositive rate) with some techniques. Both NGS and SNP array had high specificity when considered against FISH as the reference standard (NGS: 6 studies, 243 participants; SNP: 6 studies, 111 participants), although we rated certainty in the evidence as low or very low. NGS and SNP array also had high specificity when PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH was considered the reference standard, although with much more uncertainty as these results were based on fewer studies (just one study with 49 participants for NGS and two studies with 33 participants for SNP array). GÃ¢â‚¬Âbanding had low sensitivity and specificity when PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH was the reference standard. Although MS had very high sensitivity and specificity when both FISH and PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH were considered the reference standard, these results were based on only one study with a small number of participants. RealÃ¢â‚¬Âtime PCR also showed high specificity with FISH as a reference standard, although there were only two studies including 40 participants. We found no relevant economic evaluations. Our economic model using FISH as the reference standard suggested that the resourceÃ¢â‚¬Âoptimising test depends on which measure of diagnostic accuracy is most important. With FISH as the reference standard, MLPA is likely to be costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffective if society was willing to pay GBP 1000 or less for a true positive detected. However, as the value placed on a true positive increased, CISH was most costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffective. Findings differed when the outcome measure changed to either true negative detected or correct diagnosis. When PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH was used as the reference standard, MLPA was likely to be costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffective for all measures of diagnostic accuracy at lower threshold values for willingness to pay. However, as the threshold values increased, none of the tests were clearly more likely to be considered costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffective. Authors' conclusions In our review, most techniques (except GÃ¢â‚¬Âbanding) appeared to have good sensitivity (few false negatives) for detection of 1p/19q codeletions in glioma against both FISH and PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH as a reference standard. However, we judged the certainty of the evidence low or very low for all the tests. There are possible differences in specificity, with both NGS and SNP array having high specificity (fewer false positives) for 1p/19q codeletion when considered against FISH as the reference standard. The economic analysis should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies. Plain language summary Comparing different methods of determining whether gliomas are missing arms 1p and 19q of the chromosomes Why is improving the detection of 1p/19q codeletion in glioma important? Gliomas are a type of brain tumour (cancer). There are different types of glioma, with different changes in their genetic material. One of the possible genetic changes is the loss of parts of two of our 23 chromosomes. When both a specific part of chromosome 1 and a specific part of chromosome 19 are missing, it is known as '1p/19q codeletion'. 1p/19q codeletion is used to diagnose a glioma known as an oligodendroglioma. Presence of 1p/19q codeletion can also tell us how long a patient with a glioma may survive and which is the best medicine to treat that patient. What is the aim of this review? We wanted to find out which is the most accurate and costÃ¢â‚¬Âeffective way to identify 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas. What is studied in the review? The review examined and compared all methods to detect 1p/19q codeletion that are based on the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, which contains the information for an organism to develop, survive and reproduce) of the tumour. These include tests known as FISH and CISH, which are performed directly on tumour tissue and a number of other tests that are based on DNA extracted from the tumour tissue including: PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH, realÃ¢â‚¬Âtime PCR, LPA, SNP array, CGH array and NGS. None of these tests is perfect, so there is no 'gold standard' against which to compare them. The two most commonly used tests (FISH and PCRÃ¢â‚¬Âbased LOH) were used as the best available reference tests against which to examine the others. What are the main results of the review? We found 53 studies. Most tests were good at identifying instances of 1p/19q codeletion (meaning they were tests with good 'sensitivity') that had been identified by either of the two common tests. However, there were some differences in how well the tests were able to rule out 1p/19q codeletion when it did not seem to be present (the 'specificity' of the test). NGS and SNP arrays were better at this (i.e. having fewer 'falseÃ¢â‚¬Âpositives' results) when considered against FISH as the reference test. The cost per correct diagnosis was lowest for MLPA, although this was not a firm finding because the amount of evidence was small. How reliable are results of the studies in this review? Our certainty in the evidence was low or very low, because there were few studies for most of the tests and there were limitations to almost all the studies. Similarly, the economic analysis must be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small number of studies. To whom do the results of this review apply? The ways in which the tests were performed were thought to be representative of how they would be performed in practice. However, many of the studies included people with specific types of gliomas, so the results might not be representative of all people with gliomas. What are the implications of this review? The limited evidence suggests that currently used techniques show good sensitivity for detection of 1p/19q codeletion. NGS and SNP arrays may have higher specificity when FISH is the reference standard, but this comes at greater cost per test. How upÃ¢â‚¬ÂtoÃ¢â‚¬Âdate is this review?
