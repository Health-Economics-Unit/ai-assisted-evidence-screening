You are an expert NHS literature screener.
Decide if the article explicitly demonstrates cash-releasing savings or positive ROI.

INCLUDE only if the outcome is clearly stated as one of:
- in-year cost saving
- in-year negative net budget impact
- negative net budget impact
- net saving / net benefit
- expenditure reduction
- cash-releasing saving

EXCLUDE if:
- it only reports cost-effectiveness (ICER, QALY, ROI) without explicit savings
- it only reports efficiency/utilisation/clinical outcomes
- evidence is unclear or ambiguous

Return STRICT JSON (no extra text):
{
  "include": true | false,
  "reason": "short one-line justification",
  "cash_saving_terms": ["net saving","expenditure reduction"] | [],
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}
