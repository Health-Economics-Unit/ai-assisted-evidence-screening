J503,2019,Fluorides for preventing early tooth decay (demineralised lesions) during fixed brace treatment,"- Background Early dental decay or demineralised lesions (DLs, also known as white spot lesions) can appear on teeth during fixed orthodontic (brace) treatment. Fluoride reduces decay in susceptible individuals, including orthodontic patients. This review compared various forms of topical fluoride to prevent the development of DLs during orthodontic treatment. This is the second update of the Cochrane Review first published in 2004 and previously updated in 2013. Objectives The primary objective was to evaluate whether topical fluoride reduces the proportion of orthodontic patients with new DLs after fixed appliances. The secondary objectives were to examine the effectiveness of different modes of topical fluoride delivery in reducing the proportions of orthodontic patients with new DLs, as well as the severity of lesions, in terms of number, size and colour. ParticipantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âassessed outcomes, such as perception of DLs, and oral healthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated quality of life data were to be included, as would reports of adverse effects. Search methods Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases: Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 1 February 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 1) in the Cochrane Library (searched 1 February 2019), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 1 February 2019), and Embase Ovid (1980 to 1 February 2019). The US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform were searched for ongoing trials. No restrictions were placed on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases. Selection criteria ParallelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âgroup, randomised controlled trials comparing the use of a fluorideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcontaining product versus a placebo, no treatment or a different type of fluoride treatment, in which the outcome of enamel demineralisation was assessed at the start and at the end of orthodontic treatment. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently, in duplicate, conducted risk of bias assessments and extracted data. Authors of trials were contacted to obtain missing data or to ask for clarification of aspects of trial methodology. Cochrane's statistical guidelines were followed. Main results This update includes 10 studies and contains data from nine studies, comparing eight interventions, involving 1798 randomised participants (1580 analysed). One report contained insufficient information and the authors have been contacted. We assessed two studies as at low risk of bias, six at unclear risk of bias, and two at high risk of bias. Two placebo (nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âfluoride) controlled studies, at low risk of bias, investigated the professional application of varnish (7700 or 10,000 parts per million (ppm) fluoride (F)), every six weeks and found insufficient evidence of a difference regarding its effectiveness in preventing new DLs (risk ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 1.93; 405 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). One placebo (nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âfluoride) controlled study, at unclear risk of bias, provides a low level of certainty that fluoride foam (12,300 ppm F), professionally applied every two months, may reduce the incidence of new DLs (12% versus 49%) after fixed orthodontic treatment (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.57; 95 participants). One study, at unclear risk of bias, also provides a low level of certainty that use of a highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âconcentration fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm F) by patients may reduce the incidence of new DLs (18% versus 27%) compared with a conventional fluoride toothpaste (1450 ppm F) (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.00; 380 participants). There was no evidence for a difference in the proportions of orthodontic patients with new DLs on the teeth after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances for the following comparisons:ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â an amine fluoride and stannous fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse combination versus a sodium fluoride toothpaste/mouthrinse,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â an amine fluoride gel versus a nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âfluoride placebo applied by participants at home once a week and by professional application every three months,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â resinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmodified glass ionomer cement versus lightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcured composite resin for bonding orthodontic brackets,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â a 250 ppm F mouthrinse versus 0 ppm F placebo mouthrinse,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â the use of an intraoral fluorideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âreleasing glass bead device attached to the brace versus a daily fluoride mouthrinse. The last two comparisons involved studies that were assessed at high risk of bias, because a substantial number of participants were lost to followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup. Unfortunately, although the internal validity and hence the quality of the studies has improved since the first version of the review, they have compared different interventions; therefore, the findings are only considered to provide low level of certainty, because none has been replicated by followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup studies, in different settings, to confirm external validity. A patientÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âreported outcome, such as concern about the aesthetics of any DLs, was still not included as an outcome in any study. Reports of adverse effects from topical fluoride applications were rare and unlikely to be significant. One study involving fluorideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcontaining glass beads reported numerous breakages. Authors' conclusions This review found a low level of certainty that 12,300 ppm F foam applied by a professional every 6 to 8 weeks throughout fixed orthodontic treatment, might be effective in reducing the proportion of orthodontic patients with new DLs. In addition, there is a low level of certainty that the patient use of a high fluoride toothpaste (5000 ppm F) throughout orthodontic treatment, might be more effective than a conventional fluoride toothpaste. These two comparisons were based on single studies. There was insufficient evidence of a difference regarding the professional application of fluoride varnish (7700 or 10,000 ppm F). Further adequately powered, randomised controlled trials are required to increase the certainty of these findings and to determine the best means of preventing DLs in patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment. The most accurate means of assessing adherence with the use of fluoride products by patients and any possible adverse effects also need to be considered. Future studies should follow up participants beyond the end of orthodontic treatment to determine the effect of DLs on patient satisfaction with treatment. Plain language summary Fluorides for preventing early tooth decay (demineralised lesions) during fixed brace treatment Review question ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ Ugly white or brown marks sometimes appear on the teeth during treatment with braces to straighten teeth. These are due to early tooth decay and usually occur with fixed, gluedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âon 'train track', braces, which make it more difficult to clean the teeth. We know that fluoride in toothpaste helps to prevent tooth decay and think that if extra fluoride is given to people wearing fixed braces, it will protect them from getting these marks. The aim of this Cochrane Oral Health's review was to look at how well fluorides help to prevent early tooth decay during fixed brace treatment and to find out the best way to get fluoride to the teeth. Background ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ Wearing a fixed brace makes it harder for people to keep their teeth clean and may also cause pain. Pain can make it more difficult for people to brush their teeth. This can lead to a buildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup of dental plaque around the brackets that attach the fixed brace to the teeth, and if the plaque stays on the tooth for long enough, it will cause early tooth decay, which looks like white or brown marks (demineralised lesions, also known as white spot lesions). People often wear braces for 18 months or longer and if the decay is left to progress, it can cause holes, which are sometimes bad enough to need fillings to be done in the teeth. Fluoride helps the tooth to heal, reducing tooth decay in people who are at risk of developing it. People receiving fixed brace treatment may be given different forms of fluoride treatment. It is important to think about how the fluoride gets to the teeth. Does the fluoride need to be placed by a dentist or dental nurse, or can people having treatment with braces apply the fluoride to their own teeth? Study characteristics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ This review is upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdate as of 1 February 2019. The review includes 10 studies but we could only use the information from nine studies involving 1798 randomised people. We have asked for more information about one study. The review looks at eight different ways of applying fluoride to the teeth. People taking part in the studies were all having treatment with fixed braces. The number of people with new decay on the teeth at end of fixed brace treatment, as well as the amount of decay in each person, were measured and counted. We compared the following treatments:ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â dentist or nurseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âapplied fluoride e.g. varnish, gel or foam,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â patientÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âapplied/used fluoride e.g. toothpaste, mouthwash, gel or foam, andÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â materials that release fluoride over time e.g. glues, elastic bands. Key results ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ One study showed that when the dentist applies a foam with a high level of fluoride in it onto the teeth every time the patient is seen, this might reduce the risk of new decay. Another study found that if patients use a toothpaste with a higher level of fluoride than normal, then this might also reduce the risk of new marks on their teeth. No studies have shown that other ways of giving the teeth extra fluoride reduced the number and/or size of new decay on teeth in people wearing fixed braces. Harmful effects of the different ways of giving the teeth more fluoride were not reported in any of the included studies. Certainty of the evidence ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ The level of belief we have in these findings is low, due to the lack of studies testing the same fluorides and showing the same results. We suggest that more, wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âconducted studies should be done in this area.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Orthodontic treatment implies clinical setting.,TRUE,"Cochrane Review, likely peer-reviewed",Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative RCT with clinical and PRO outcomes.,TRUE,Placebo,TRUE,"['clinical', 'pro']",0.95,TRUE,Focuses on preventing dental lesions during orthodontic treatment.,Prevention,Prevention,1
J505,2019,Fetal fibronectin testing for reducing the risk of preterm birth,"- Background Fetal fibronectin (FFN) is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein localized at the maternalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âfetal interface of the amniotic membranes, between chorion and decidua, where it is concentrated in this area between decidua and trophoblast. In normal conditions, FFN is found at very low levels in cervicovaginal secretions. Levels greater than or equal to 50 ng/mL at or after 22 weeks have been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth. In fact, FFN is one of the best predictors of preterm birth in all populations studied so far, and can help in selecting which women are at significant risk for preterm birth. This is an update of a review first published in 2008. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of management based on knowledge of FFN testing results for preventing preterm birth. Search methods For this update, we searched Cochrane Pregnancy and ChildbirthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Trials Register (7 September 2018), ClinicalTrials.gov , the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) (7 September 2018), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials of pregnant women screened with FFN for risk of preterm birth. Studies included are based exclusively on knowledge of FFN results versus no such knowledge, and we have excluded studies including women with only positive or only negative FFN results. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked them for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Main results We identified 16 trials, of which six were eligible for inclusion. The six included studies randomized 546 women with singleton gestations and threatened preterm labor (PTL) at 23 0/7 to 34 6/7 weeks. A total of 277 women were randomized to knowledge and 269 to no knowledge of FFN. No trials were identified on asymptomatic women or multiple gestations. The risk of bias of included studies was mixed. For selected important outcomes, preterm birth before 37, 34, and 32 weeks, and maternal hospitalization, we graded the quality of the evidence and created a 'Summary of findings' table. For these outcomes, the evidence was graded as mainly low quality due to the imprecision of effect estimates. Management based on knowledge of FFN results may reduce preterm birth before 37 weeks (20.7%) versus controls without such knowledge (29.2%) (risk ratio (RR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52 to 1.01; 5 trials; 434 women; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence). However, management based on knowledge of FFN results may make little or no difference to preterm birth before 34 (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.18; 4 trials; 357 women; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence) or maternal hospitalization (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.43; 5 trials; 441 women; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence). The evidence for preterm birth before 32 weeks is uncertain because the quality was found to be very low (average RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.96; 4 trials; 357 women; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence). For all other outcomes, for which there were available data (preterm birth less than 28 weeks; gestational age at delivery (weeks); birthweight less than 2500 g; perinatal death; tocolysis; steroids for fetal lung maturity; time to evaluate; respiratory distress syndrome; neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission; and NICU days), knowledge of FFN results may make little or no difference to the outcomes. Authors' conclusions The evidence from this review suggests that management based on knowledge of FFN results may reduce preterm birth before 37 weeks. However, our confidence in this result is limited as the evidence was found to be of low quality. Effects on other substantive outcomes are uncertain due to serious concerns in study design, inconsistency, and imprecision of effect estimates. No trials were identified on asymptomatic women, or multiple gestations. Future studies are needed that include specific populations (e.g. singleton gestations with symptoms of preterm labor), a study gro p managed with a protocol based on the FFN results, and that report not only maternal but also important perinatal outcomes. CostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffectiveness analyses are also needed. Plain language summary Fetal fibronectin testing for reducing the risk of preterm birth What is the issue? To assess the effectiveness of management of pregnant women based on a knowledge of fetal fibronectin test results for preventing preterm birth, compared with not having that knowledge. Fetal fibronectin (FFN) acts as a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“glueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ between the pregnancy and the uterus. Normally very low levels of FFN can be found in secretions of the vagina and cervix. Raised levels at or after 22 weeks have been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous preterm birth. Why is this important? Preterm birth before 37 weeks is the main cause of sickness and death for newborn infants. Most women who give birth preterm have preterm labor symptoms such as contractions but many of the women with symptoms go on to deliver at term (37 weeks or more). Fetal fibronectin (FFN) is a test that can identify the women with symptoms of preterm labor who are most at risk for preterm birth. The level of FFN is measured in secretions from the vagina or cervix. What evidence did we find? We found six randomised controlled studies involving 546 women who were pregnant with one baby and were showing signs of preterm labor at between 23 to 34 weeks' gestation. We graded the following evidence as mainly low quality because of the low number of women in the studies and a wide variation in findings. We found that the number of births before 37 weeks may be slightly reduced when women and their doctors know the results of the FFN test (20.7% versus 29.2%; 5 trials; 434 women). However, knowledge of FFN results may make little or no difference for the other outcomes with available data, including: maternal hospitalization (5 trials; 441 women); use of uterine relaxants (tocolysis) to try to prevent labor; earlier preterm births; womenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gestational age at delivery; babies with a birthweight less than 2500 g; newborn deaths; the number of babies with respiratory distress syndrome; giving steroids to mature the unborn babiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ lungs; and number of days in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). What does this mean? This review of six studies did not find enough evidence to say whether or not the FFN test should be used in the management of women showing signs of preterm labor. A screening test such as FFN can only be considered effective if interventions based on the screening results, such as giving drugs to relax the uterus, reduce the number of preterm births.

J506,2019,Cervical assessment by ultrasound for preventing preterm delivery,"- Background Measurement of cervical length by ultrasound is predictive of preterm birth (PTB). There are three methods of ultrasound cervical assessment: transvaginal (TVU), transabdominal (TAU), and transperineal (TPU, also called translabial). Cervical length measured by TVU is a relatively new screening test, and has been associated with better prediction of PTB than previously available tests. It is unclear if cervical length measured by ultrasound is effective for preventing PTB. This is an update of a review last published in 2013. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of antenatal management based on transvaginal, transabdominal, and transperineal (also called translabial) ultrasound screening of cervical length for preventing preterm birth. Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and ChildbirthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov , and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP ) to 30 August 2018; reviewed the reference lists of all articles, and contacted experts in the field for additional and ongoing trials. Selection criteria We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCT) including pregnant women between the gestational ages of 14 to 32 weeks, for whom the cervical length was screened for risk of PTB with TVU, TAU, or TPU. This review focused on studies based on knowledge versus no knowledge of cervical length results, or ultrasound versus no ultrasound for cervical length. We excluded studies based on interventions (e.g. progesterone, cerclage) for short cervical length. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methods. Main results We included seven RCTs (N = 923): one examined asymptomatic women with twin pregnancies; four included women with singleton pregnancies and symptoms of preterm labour (PTL); one included women with singleton pregnancies and symptoms of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM); and one included asymptomatic singletons. All trials used TVU for screening. We assessed the risk of bias of the included studies as mixed, and the quality of the evidence for primary outcomes as very low for all populations. For asymptomatic women with twin pregnancies, it is uncertain whether knowledge of TVUÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmeasured cervical length compared to no knowledge reduces PTB at less than 34 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.62, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.30 to 1.25; 1 study, 125 participants) because the quality of the evidence is very low. The results were also inconclusive for preterm birth at 36, 32, or 30 weeks; gestational age at birth, and other maternal and perinatal outcomes. Four trials examined knowledge of TVUÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmeasured cervical length of singletons with symptoms of PTL versus no knowledge. We are uncertain of the effects because of inconclusive results and very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence for: preterm births at less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.32; 2 studies, 242 participants; IÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â² = 66%; TauÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â² = 0.23). Birth occurred about four days later in the knowledge groups (mean difference (MD) 0.64 weeks, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.25; 3 trials, 290 women). The results were inconclusive for the other outcomes for which there were available data: PTB at less than 34 or 28 weeks; birthweight less than 2500 g; perinatal death; maternal hospitalisation; tocolysis; and steroids for fetal lung maturity. The trial of singletons with PPROM (N = 92) evaluated safety of using TVU to measure cervical length in this population as its primary outcome, not its effect on management. The results were inconclusive for incidence of maternal and neonatal infections between the TVU and no ultrasound groups. In the trial of asymptomatic singletons (N = 296), in which women either received TVU or not, the results were inconclusive for preterm birth at less than 37 weeks (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.61 to 2.61; IÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â² = 0%), gestational age at birth, and other perinatal and maternal outcomes. We downgraded evidence for limitations in study design, inconsistency between the trials, and imprecision, due to small sample si e and wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. No trial compared the effect of knowledge of the CL with no knowledge of CL in other populations, such as asymptomatic women with singleton pregnancies, or symptomatic women with twin pregnancies. Authors' conclusions There are limited data on the effects of knowing the cervical length, measured by ultrasound, for preventing preterm births, which preclude us from drawing any conclusions for women with asymptomatic twin or singleton pregnancies, singleton pregnancies with PPROM, or other populations and clinical scenarios. Limited evidence suggests that knowledge of transvaginal ultrasoundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmeasured cervical length, used to inform the management of women with singleton pregnancies and symptoms of preterm labour, appears to prolong pregnancy by about four days over women in the no knowledge groups. Future studies could look at specific populations separately (e.g. singleton versus twins; symptoms versus no symptoms of PTL), report on all pertinent maternal and perinatal outcomes, and include costÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffectiveness analyses. Most importantly, future studies should include a clear protocol for management of women based on TVUÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmeasured cervical length. Plain language summary Cervical assessment by ultrasound for preventing preterm delivery We set out to assess the effectiveness of knowing the cervical length, measured with ultrasound, for preventing preterm birth compared with not knowing the cervical length. What is the issue? The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. When women are not pregnant, it is normally at least 3 cm long. During pregnancy, a short cervical length is associated with a risk of spontaneous preterm birth. The shorter the cervical length, the greater the risk. Therefore, measuring cervical length by ultrasound can help predict spontaneous preterm birth. The cervical length is measured by an ultrasound scan through the vagina (transvaginal or TVU), abdomen (transabdominal), or the perineum (transperineal). The most common causes of spontaneous preterm birth are preterm labour or preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Many of the interventions used to prevent preterm birth are used once symptoms develop. Why is this important? Preterm birth before 37 weeks is the main cause of a newborn baby being sick and disabled, or dying. The cervix is the opening or passage through which the baby must pass before being born vaginally. Ultrasound can detect early changes of the cervix, such as shortening of the cervical length, to predict preterm birth. On identifying a short cervical length, interventions can be applied to prevent preterm birth. These interventions include giving the expectant mother progesterone to relax the uterus, or applying a stitch, known as a cerclage, to tighten the opening of the cervix. What evidence did we find? This review assessed if knowing the cervical length can prevent preterm birth. We included seven randomised controlled studies, which involved 923 pregnant women at 14 to 32 weeks' gestation. One study included expectant mothers with twins, without any symptoms of preterm birth or labour, and looked at the number of babies born prematurely before 36 weeks. Four studies included expectant mothers of single babies with threatened preterm labour, and one study involving women with premature rupture of the membranes looked at the safety of transvaginal ultrasound. One trial included expectant mothers with singleton pregnancies who did not have any symptoms of preterm birth or labour to look at the efficacy of transvaginal ultrasound cervical length screening. All studies used transvaginal ultrasound to assess cervical length. For women with twin pregnancies and not showing symptoms of preterm birth, we are unclear of the impact of knowing the cervical length on whether babies are born before 34 weeks' gestation, or their gestational age at birth (1 study, 125 women), because we assessed the quality of the evidence to be very low. For women with a single baby and threatened preterm labour, knowledge of their cervical length may have led to a longer pregnancy by about four days (4 studies, 410 women), but the evidence on the number of babies born before 37 weeks was unclear (2 studies, 242 women). For women whose waters had broken, it is unclear whether healthcare provider knowledge makes any difference to whether the women gave birth preterm, or on the number of infections, again because we judged the quality of evidence as very low. For women with singleton pregnancies not showing symptoms of preterm birth, it is unclear whether an ultrasound to measure cervical length made any difference to whether their babies were born before 37 weeks' gestation (1 study, 296 women; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence). What does this mean? We found a limited number of studies including small numbers of women. The studies varied in their design and had a broad spread of results. Women were not blinded to whether they had an ultrasound or not. Currently, there is not enough high quality research to show if knowledge of cervical length in women with twin or singleton pregnancies has any effect. Future studies could include ways of managing women as a result of the cervical length results, and it would be useful to look at specific populations separately, such as single babies versus twins and women with and without symptoms of preterm labour. They could also report on all important maternal and perinatal outcomes, and include costÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffectiveness analyses.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,"Study involves antenatal ultrasound screening, likely in NHS or community health settings.",TRUE,"Unclear publication type, flagged for review",Unknown,0.6,TRUE,RCTs with comparator and clinical/safety outcomes,TRUE,No intervention/Do nothing,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety', 'utilization']",0.9,TRUE,Ultrasound screening aims to prevent preterm birth.,Prevention,Prevention,0.9
J509,2019,"Burden of varicella complications in secondary care, England, 2004 to 2017","Background: Strategies to control varicella vary across Europe. Evidence from established programmes has prompted the United Kingdom to re-evaluate the need for universal vaccination. The burden of complicated varicella is a key parameter in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Aim(s): Our objective was to estimate the burden of complicated varicella in England. Method(s): This electronic health record surveillance study used data from all NHS hospitals in England to identify varicella admissions between 2004 and 2017. The incidence of pre-defined complications of varicella was estimated using ICD-10 codes. Inpatient costs were calculated based on the payment rules for providers of NHS services. Result(s): There were 61,024 admissions with varicella between 2004 and 2017 and 38.1% had a recognised varicella complication. Incidence of hospitalisation increased by 25% and the proportion with complicated varicella by 24% from 2004/05 to 2016/17. The most common complications were bacterial skin infections (11.25%), pneumonia (4.82%), febrile convulsions (3.39%) and encephalitis (2.44%). Complication rates were higher in older age groups and the type of complications more severe. Length of stay for complicated varicella was 3.1 times longer than for uncomplicated varicella and inpatient costs were 72% greater. Conclusion(s): Complicated varicella has a substantial health and economic burden. These data together with data on impact on quality of life are important in informing the cost-effectiveness analysis of universal varicella vaccination.

J515,2019,What evidence is available to support the development of a regional specialist neurorehabilitation outreach service,"Background The WHO recognises several specialist rehabilitation provision models; in-patient, outpatient and outreach. Intensive early neurorehabilitation is required after severe Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), usually necessitating in-patient care. In the UK, children receiving specialist neurorehabilitation often remain in-patients for long periods because of the lack of appropriate out-of-hospital provision. Aims To explore feasibility and funding implications of developing a regional specialist neurorehabilitation outreach service to facilitate earlier discharge. Methods Analysis of data on children receiving in-patient neurorehabilitation at a paediatric Regional Neuroscience Centre (RNSC), 2014-2018. Information concerning therapy provision was obtained from Trust Clinical Information System Suite (CISS). Patient dependency and rehabilitation complexity was assessed by Rehabilitation Complexity Scale-Extended (RCS-E), scored by multi-disciplinary team (MDT) at weekly meetings over 15 months. For modelling purposes, a specialist neurorehabilitation outreach tariff equating to 50% in-patient tariff was assumed. Data analysis was undertaken by linear programming model (XpressIveÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â©) and Discrete-Even Simulation (Simul8 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©).Various eligibility criteria for outreach provision were modelled: 1) needing >=1 therapies<3 times/week; 2) Total RCS-E score <9,<11 or<13; 3) Therapy Dependency (TD) +Therapy Intensity (TI) components of RCS-E <5. Results 156 children received neurorehabilitation as in-patients over 4 years. Mean age=7.34 years (range 0.1-17). 66 (55%) were male, 53 (45%) female. 84% had ABI, others acquired spinal injury, acute polyneuropathy or somatisation disorders. 52% lived >40 miles from RNSC, 47%>60 min' drive away. 49% were inpatients 1-28 days; 34%, 29-84 days; 18, 85-168 days; 6,>168 days. Patients showed significant functional improvements between admission to neurorehabilitation and discharge (p<0.001). Modelling suggests 14 outreach centres, including RNSC, would be required to permit 78% patients to access specialist neurorehabilitation <30 mins drive from home; 10 centres would permit 92% to access neurorehabilitation <45 min' drive away; 8 centres would permit 96% to access neurorehabilitation <60 min' drive away. Calculations assuming outreach tariff=50% in-patient tariff, and various RCS data models, suggest annual cost savings ranging from 53,424-166,950; calculations based on CISS data, suggest average savings of 1 05 596 per year (range 98,500-113,526).

J523,2019,Perioperative betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers for preventing surgeryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcardiac surgery,"- Background Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers to influence perioperative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus routine prescription of these drugs in an unselected population remains a controversial issue. A previous version of this review assessing the effectiveness of perioperative betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers in cardiac and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcardiac surgery was last published in 2018. The previous review has now been split into two reviews according to type of surgery. This is an update, and assesses the evidence in nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcardiac surgery only. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of perioperatively administered betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers for the prevention of surgeryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated mortality and morbidity in adults undergoing nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcardiac surgery. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis Previews and Conference Proceedings Citation IndexÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂScience on 28 June 2019. We searched clinical trials registers and grey literature, and conducted backwardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and forwardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcitation searching of relevant articles. Selection criteria We included RCTs and quasiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârandomized studies comparing betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers with a control (placebo or standard care) administered during the perioperative period to adults undergoing nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcardiac surgery. If studies included surgery with different types of anaesthesia, we included them if 70% participants, or at least 100 participants, received general anaesthesia. We excluded studies in which all participants in the standard care control group were given a pharmacological agent that was not given to participants in the intervention group, studies in which all participants in the control group were given a betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblocker, and studies in which betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers were given with an additional agent (e.g. magnesium). We excluded studies that did not measure or report review outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. Main results We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 participants; we found no quasiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârandomized studies. All participants were undergoing nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcardiac surgery, and types of surgery ranged from low to high risk. Types of betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. In nine studies, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers were titrated according to heart rate or blood pressure. Duration of administration varied between studies, as did the time at which drugs were administered; in most studies, it was intraoperatively, but in 18 studies it was before surgery, in six postoperatively, one multiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âarm study included groups of different timings, and one study did not report timing of drug administration. Overall, we found that more than half of the studies did not sufficiently report methods used for randomization. All studies in which the control was standard care were at high risk of performance bias because of the openÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âlabel study design. Only two studies were prospectively registered with clinical trials registers, which limited the assessment of reporting bias. In six studies, participants in the control group were given betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers as rescue therapy during the study period. The evidence for allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcause mortality at 30 days was uncertain; based on the risk of death in the control group of 25 per 1000, the effect with betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers was between two fewer and 13 more per 1000 (risk ratio (RR) 1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.54; 16 studies, 11,446 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction by 13 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.87; 12 studies, 10,520 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events (RR 1.65, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.81; 6 studies, 9460 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence), or in ventricular arrhythmias (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.47; 5 studies, 47 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may reduce atrial fibrillation or flutter by 26 fewer incidences per 1000 (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.79; 9 studies, 9080 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). However, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may increase bradycardia by 55 more incidences per 1000 (RR 2.49, 95% CI 1.74 to 3.56; 49 studies, 12,239 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence), and hypotension by 44 more per 1000 (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.51; 49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence owing to study limitations; some studies had high risks of bias, and the effects were sometimes altered when we excluded studies with a standard care control group (including only placeboÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcontrolled trials showed an increase in early mortality and cerebrovascular events with betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers). We also downgraded for inconsistency; one large, wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âconducted, international study found a reduction in myocardial infarction, and an increase in cerebrovascular events and allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcause mortality, when betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers were used, but other studies showed no evidence of a difference. We could not explain the reason for the inconsistency in the evidence for ventricular arrhythmias, and we also downgraded this outcome for imprecision because we found few studies with few participants. Authors' conclusions The evidence for early allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcause mortality with perioperative betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers was uncertain. We found no evidence of a difference in cerebrovascular events or ventricular arrhythmias, and the certainty of the evidence for these outcomes was low and very low. We found lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence that betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may reduce atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarctions. However, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may increase bradycardia (lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence) and probably increase hypotension (moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Further evidence from large placeboÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcontrolled trials is likely to increase the certainty of these findings, and we recommend the assessment of impact on quality of life. We found 18 studies awaiting classification; inclusion of these studies in future updates may also increase the certainty of the evidence. Plain language summary BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers to prevent death or serious events after surgery not involving the heart This review assessed evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on whether betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers reduce deaths or other serious events when given to people undergoing surgery other than heart surgery. The findings for heart surgery are covered in another review. Background Surgery increases stress in the body, which responds by releasing the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. Stress from surgery can lead to death or other serious events such as heart attacks, stroke, or an irregular heartbeat. For surgery that does not involve the heart, an estimated 8% of people may have injury to their heart around the time of surgery. BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers are drugs that block the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers can slow down the heart, and reduce blood pressure, and this may reduce the risk of serious events. However, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may lead to a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure which could increase the risk of death or a stroke. Prevention of early complications after surgery is important, but using betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers to prevent these complications is controversial. Study characteristics The evidence is current to 28 June 2019. We included 83 RCTs with 14,967 adults who were undergoing different types of surgery other than heart surgery. Eighteen studies are awaiting classification (because we did not have enough details to assess them), and three studies are ongoing. The types of betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers used in the studies were: propranolol, metoprolol, esmolol, landiolol, nadolol, atenolol, labetalol, oxprenolol, and pindolol. Studies compared these betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers with either a placebo (disguised to look like a betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblocker but containing no medicine) or with standard care. Key results BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may make l ttle or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days of surgery (16 studies, 11,446 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence), have a stroke (6 studies, 9460 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence), or experience ventricular arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat rhythms, starting in the main chambers of the heart, that are potentially lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âthreatening and may need immediate medical treatment; 5 studies, 476 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). We found that betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may reduce atrial fibrillation (an irregular heartbeat, starting in the atrial chambers of the heart, that increases the risk of stroke if untreated; 9 studies, 9080 participants; low certaintyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âevidence), and the number of people who have a heart attack (12 studies, 10,520 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). However, taking betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may increase the number of people who experience a very low heart rate (49 studies, 12,239 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence), or very low blood pressure (49 studies, 12,304 participants; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence), around the time of surgery. In a few studies, we also found little or no difference in the number of people who died after 30 days, who died because of a heart problem, or had heart failure. We found no evidence of whether betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers alter the length of time in hospital. No studies assessed whether people who were given betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers had a better quality of life after heart surgery. Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence in this review was limited by including some studies that were at high risk of bias, and we noticed that some of our findings were different if we only included placeboÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcontrolled studies or studies that reported how participants were randomized. We also found one large, wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âconducted, international study that had different findings to the smaller studies. It showed a reduction in heart attacks and an increase in stroke and allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcause mortality when betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers were used, whilst the other studies did not show a clear effect. We were also less certain of the findings for outcomes with few studies, such as for ventricular arrhythmias. Conclusion Although betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may make little or no difference to the number of people who die within 30 days, have a stroke, or have ventricular arrhythmias, they may reduce atrial fibrillation and heart attacks. Taking betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may increase the number of people with a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure around the time of surgery.

We excluded studies that did not measure or report review outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE. Main results We included 63 studies with 7768 participants; six studies were quasiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârandomized and the remaining were RCTs. All participants were undergoing cardiac surgery, and in most studies, at least some of the participants were previously taking betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers. Types of betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, sotalol, esmolol, landiolol, acebutolol, timolol, carvedilol, nadolol, and atenolol. In twelve studies, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers were titrated according to heart rate or blood pressure. Duration of administration varied between studies, as did the time at which drugs were administered; in nine studies this was before surgery, in 20 studies during surgery, and in the remaining studies betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers were started postoperatively. Overall, we found that most studies did not report sufficient details for us to adequately assess risk of bias. In particular, few studies reported methods used to randomize participants to groups. In some studies, participants in the control group were given betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers as rescue therapy during the study period, and all studies in which the control was standard care were at high risk of performance bias because of the openÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âlabel study design. No studies were prospectively registered with clinical trials registers, which limited the assessment of reporting bias. We judged 68% studies to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Study authors reported few deaths (7 per 1000 in both the intervention and control groups), and we found lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence that betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may make little or no difference to allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcause mortality at 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.90; 29 studies, 4099 participants). For myocardial infarctions, we found no evidence of a difference in events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.52; 25 studies, 3946 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Few study authors reported cerebrovascular events, and the evidence was uncertain (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.51 to 3.67; 5 studies, 1471 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Based on a control risk of 54 per 1000, we found lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence that betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may reduce episodes of ventr cular arrhythmias by 32 episodes per 1000 (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.63; 12 studies, 2296 participants). For atrial fibrillation or flutter, there may be 163 fewer incidences with betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers, based on a control risk of 327 incidences per 1000 (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.59; 40 studies, 5650 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). However, the evidence for bradycardia and hypotension was less certain. We found that betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may make little or no difference to bradycardia (RR 1.63, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.91; 12 studies, 1640 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence), or hypotension (RR 1.84, 95% CI 0.89 to 3.80; 10 studies, 1538 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). We used GRADE to downgrade the certainty of evidence. Owing to studies at high risk of bias in at least one domain, we downgraded each outcome for study limitations. Based on effect size calculations in the previous review, we found an insufficient number of participants in all outcomes (except atrial fibrillation) and, for some outcomes, we noted a wide confidence interval; therefore, we also downgraded outcomes owing to imprecision. The evidence for atrial fibrillation and length of hospital stay had a moderate level of statistical heterogeneity which we could not explain, and we, therefore, downgraded these outcomes for inconsistency. Authors' conclusions We found no evidence of a difference in early allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcause mortality, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, hypotension and bradycardia. However, there may be a reduction in atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias when betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers are used. A larger sample size is likely to increase the certainty of this evidence. Four studies awaiting classification may alter the conclusions of this review. Plain language summary BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers to prevent death or serious events after heart surgery This review assessed evidence of whether betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers given around the time of surgery can reduce death or other serious events for people undergoing heart surgery. Background People undergoing heart surgery are at greater risk of complications and death. Heart surgery increases the amount of stress in the body, causing the release of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. This stress can lead to serious events including death, heart attacks, stroke, or an irregular heartbeat. BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers are drugs that block the action of adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart. BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers can slow down the heart and reduce blood pressure, and this effect may reduce the risk of serious events. However, they can also lead to a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure, and this effect may increase the risk of death or a stroke. Prevention of complications around the time of surgery is an important safety consideration for people undergoing heart surgery. Study characteristics The evidence is current to 28 June 2019. We included 63 studies with 7768 adults who were undergoing heart surgery, including coronary artery bypass graft and valve replacement surgery. Studies were mostly randomized controlled studies, and six were quasiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârandomized (participants were allocated to groups by methods such as using hospital record numbers or dates of birth). The types of betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers were: propranolol, metoprolol, sotalol, esmolol, landiolol, acebutolol, timolol, carvedilol, nadolol, and atenolol. These betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers were compared with either a placebo (disguised to look like a betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblocker but containing no medicine) or with standard care. BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers were started before surgery, during surgery or at the latest by the end of the first day after surgery. The length of time betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers were given varied between studies. In most studies, at least some of the people were already taking betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers, which would be expected for people who had conditions that needed heart surgery. Key results BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers probably make little or no difference to the number of people who die (29 studies, 4099 participants) or have a heart attack (25 studies, 3946 participants) within 30 days of surgery. This w s supported by lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence. Few studies reported on people who had a stroke, and we were uncertain whether or not betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers reduced strokes because the certainty of the evidence was very low (5 studies, 1471 participants). BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may reduce atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heartbeat starting in the atrial chambers of the heart that increases the risk of stroke if untreated (40 studies, 5650 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may also reduce ventricular arrhythmias, which are potentially lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âthreatening irregular heartbeat rhythms originating in the main chambers of the heart, and which may need immediate medical treatment (12 studies, 2296 participants). We found that betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may make little or no difference to whether people experience a very low heart rate or very low blood pressure. We were uncertain whether betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers made a difference to the number of deaths up to a year after surgery (3 studies, 511 participants), to death because of the heart (4 studies, 320 participants), or to people who had heart failure (3 studies, 311 participants). The certainty of this evidence was very low. People who took betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers had a shorter hospital stay by about half a day (14 studies, 2450 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). No studies assessed whether people on betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers had a better quality of life after heart surgery. Certainty of the evidence The certainty of the evidence in this review was mostly low. We found that many studies reported methods that we believed could influence the results. For example, many studies did not use a placeboÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcontrol and the doctors might, therefore, have treated people differently in each group. We were unable to explain some of the differences that we found in the data for atrial fibrillation. We also needed to have evidence from a larger number of participants to be very confident in our findings. Conclusion BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers may be beneficial for people who are undergoing cardiac surgery because they may reduce the number of people who experience atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmias.

J535,2019,Interventions for prodromal stage of psychosis,"- Background Psychosis is a serious mental condition characterised by a loss of contact with reality. There may be a prodromal period or stage of psychosis, where early signs of symptoms indicating onset of first episode psychosis (FEP) occur. A number of services, incorporating multimodal treatment approaches (pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions), developed worldwide, now focus on this prodromal period with the aim of preventing psychosis in people at risk of developing FEP. Objectives The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of early interventions for people in the prodromal stage of psychosis. The secondary objective is, if possible, to compare the effectiveness of the various different interventions. Search methods We searched Cochrane Schizophrenia's studyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased Register of studies (including trials registers) on 8 June 2016 and 4 August 2017. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating interventions for participants older than 12 years, who had developed a prodromal stage of psychosis. Data collection and analysis Review authors independently inspected citations, selected studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality. Main results We included 20 studies with 2151 participants. The studies analysed 13 different comparisons. Group A comparisons explored the absolute effects of the experimental intervention. Group B were comparisons within which we could not be clear whether differential interactive effects were also ongoing. Group C comparisons explored differential effects between clearly distinct treatments. A key outcome for this review was ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“transition to psychosisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. For details of other main outcomes please see 'Summary of findings' tables. In Group A (comparisons of absolute effects) we found no clear difference between amino acids and placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.48 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08 to 2.98; 2 RCTs, 52 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence). When omegaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â3 fatty acids were compared to placebo, fewer participants given the omegaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â3 (10%) transitioned to psychosis compared to the placebo group (33%) during longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup of seven years (RR 0.24 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 1 RCT, 81 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence). In Group B (comparisons where complex interactions are probable) and in the subgroup focusing on antipsychotic drugs added to specific care packages, the amisulpiride + needsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âfocused intervention (NFI) compared to NFI comparison (no reporting of transition to psychosis; 1 RCT, 102 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence) and the olanzapine + supportive intervention compared to supportive intervention alone comparison (RR 0.58 95% CI 0.28 to 1.18; 1 RCT, 60 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence) showed no clear differences between groups. In the second Group B subgroup (cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT)), when CBT + supportive therapy was compared with supportive therapy alone around 8% of participants allocated to the combination of CBT and supportive therapy group transitioned to psychosis during followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup by 18 months, compared with double that percentage in the supportive therapy alone group (RR 0.45 95% CI 0.23 to 0.89; 2 RCTs, 252 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence). The CBT + risperidone versus CBT + placebo comparison identified no clear difference between treatments (RR 1.02 95% CI 0.39 to 2.67; 1 RCT, 87 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence) and this also applies to the CBT + needsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased intervention (NBI) + risperidone versus NBI comparison (RR 0.75 95% CI 0.39 to 1.46; 1 RCT, 59 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence). Group C (differential effects) also involved six comparisons. The first compared CBT with supportive therapy. No clear difference was found for the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“transition to psychosisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ outcome (RR 0.74 95% CI 0.28 to 1.98; 1 RCT, 72 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence). The second subgroup compared CBT + supportive intervention was compared with a NBI + supportive intervention, again, data were equivocal, few and of very low quality (RR 6.32 95% CI 0.34 to 117.09; 1 RCT, 57 participants). In the CBT + risperidone versus supportive therapy comparison, again there was no clear difference between groups (RR 0.76 95% CI 0.28 to 2.03; 1 RCT, 71 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence). The three other comparisons in Group C demonstrated no clear differences between treatment groups. When cognitive training was compared to active control (tablet games) (no reporting of transition to psychosis; 1 RCT, 62 participants; very low quality data), family treatment compared with enhanced care comparison (RR 0.54 95% CI 0.18 to 1.59; 2 RCTs, 229 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence) and integrated treatment compared to standard treatment comparison (RR 0.57 95% CI 0.28 to 1.15; 1 RCT, 79 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence) no effects of any of these approaches was evident. Authors' conclusions There has been considerable research effort in this area and several interventions have been trialled. The evidence available suggests that omegaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â3 fatty acids may prevent transition to psychosis but this evidence is low quality and more research is needed to confirm this finding. Other comparisons did not show any clear differences in effect for preventing transition to psychosis but again, the quality of this evidence is very low or low and not strong enough to make firm conclusions. Plain language summary Early interventions for people at risk of developing psychosis Review question Is there highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence indicating that interventions for people at risk of developing psychosis are effective? Background Psychoses are serious mental conditions characterised by a loss of contact with reality. The first clear episode of psychosis can be preceded by a 'prodromal' period of at least six months, where a person experiences gradual nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âspecific changes in thoughts, perceptions, behaviours and functioning. Although an individual is experiencing changes, they have not yet started to experience the more obvious psychotic symptoms such as delusions (fixed false beliefs) or hallucinations (perceptions without a cause). A number of services with treatment approaches that combine pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychosocial treatments, developed worldwide, are now focusing on prevention of psychosis in people at risk by giving treatments during this prodromal period. This review assesses the evidence available concerning the effects of different treatment approaches for people not yet diagnosed with a non affective psychosis but who are in the prodromal stage of psychosis. Searching for evidence On 8 June 2016 and 4 August 2017 we ran electronic searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia's specialised register of studies in order to find clinical studies that randomly allocated individuals at risk of developing psychosis to receive various treatments for preventing development of psychosis. Evidence found We were able to include 20 studies with 2151 participants. These studies analysed a wide range of treatments. All the review findings are of, at very best, low quality. There is some suggestion from one small study that people at risk of psychosis may benefit from taking omegaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â3 fatty acids in terms of reduced transition to psychosis. Other studies found adding antipsychotic drugs to supportiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcare packages did not seem to make much difference in terms of transition to full illness. When cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) + supportive therapy was compared with supportive therapy alone around 8% of participants treated allocated to the combination of CBT and supportive therapy transitioned to psychosis during followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup by 18 months, compared with double that percentage in people who just received supportive therapy. This could be important but these data are of very low quality. All other testing of CBT and other packages of care found no clear difference between treatments for transition to psychosis. Conclusions There has been considerable effort and expense invested testing treatment approaches for prevention of the first episode of schizophr nia. Currently, there is some lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence suggesting that omegaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â3 fatty acids may be effective, but there is no highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence to suggest that any type of treatment is effective, and no firm conclusions can be made.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Interventions likely occur in community health settings.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article with study results.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,RCTs with placebo and active comparators measuring clinical outcomes.,TRUE,Placebo,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety']",0.95,TRUE,Focuses on preventing transition to psychosis.,Prevention,Prevention,0.95
J537,2019,Screening Women for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms: Clinical and Economic Effectiveness Results from a Discrete Event Simulation Model,"Introduction - Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening programmes have been established for men in several countries. Whether screening should be extended to women is uncertain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of population screening for AAA in women, and compare a range of screening options. Methods - A discrete event simulation model was developed to provide a clinically realistic model of screening, surveillance, and elective and emergency AAA repair in women. Input parameters specifically for women were obtained from surgical registries, published literature and national administrative datasets. Screening was modelled for women aged 65 years or over. The model was run for 10-million women, with parameter uncertainty addressed by probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. UK costs in pounds sterling were converted to Euros based on 2016 average OECD purchasing power parity. Results - The prevalence of AAA (aortic diameter 33.0cm) was estimated as 0.43% in women aged 65 years and 1.15% at age 75. The corresponding attendance rates following invitation to screening were estimated as 73% and 62%. The base-case model adopted the same age at screening (65 years), definition of AAA (33.0cm), surveillance intervals (1 year for 3.0-4.4cm AAAs, 3 months for 4.5-5.4cm) and AAA diameter for consideration of surgery (5.5cm) as in the UK NHS AAA screening programmes. For screening at age 65, per woman invited to screening, the estimated gain in QALYs was 0.00075 (just under one day of life per woman screened), and the incremental cost was 33.51 (36.33) (all values discounted). This gave an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 45,000 (48,782) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained (current UK threshold for implementation approximately 20,000 (21,681)). Under the base-case model around 2800 women would need to be invited to screening to prevent one death from AAA and screening would cost 100,000 (108,406) per death from AAA prevented (non-discounted). Sensitivity analyses did not bring the ICER below 20,000 per QALY gained, with the exception of doubling the AAA prevalence to 0.86% where the ICER was 18,000 (19,513). Alternative screening options (increasing the screening age to 70 years, lowering the threshold for considering surgery to 5.0 or 4.5cm, lowering the diameter defining an AAA in women to 2.5cm, and lengthening the surveillance intervals for the smallest AAAs) did not bring the ICER below 30,000 (32,522) per QALY gained when considered either singly or in combination.

J544,2019,PRIMEtime CE: a multistate life table model for estimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions affecting diet and physical activity,"BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases are the leading cause of death in England, and poor diet and physical inactivity are two of the principle behavioural risk factors. In the context of increasingly constrained financial resources, decision makers in England need to be able to compare the potential costs and health outcomes of different public health policies aimed at improving these risk factors in order to know where to invest so that they can maximise population health. This paper describes PRIMEtime CE, a multistate life table cost-effectiveness model that can directly compare interventions affecting multiple disease outcomes. METHOD(S): The multistate life table model, PRIMEtime Cost Effectiveness (PRIMEtime CE), is developed from the Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl (PRIME) and the PRIMEtime model. PRIMEtime CE uses routinely available data to estimate how changing diet and physical activity in England affects morbidity and mortality from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, liver disease, and cancers either directly or via raised blood pressure, cholesterol, and body weight. RESULT(S): Model outcomes are change in quality adjusted life years, and change in English National Health Service and social care costs. CONCLUSION(S): This paper describes PRIMEtime CE and highlights its main strengths and limitations. The model can be used to compare any number of public policies affecting diet and physical activity, allowing decision makers to understand how they can maximise population health with limited financial resources.",TRUE,"Study conducted in England, references NHS",TRUE,Model estimates NHS and social care costs.,TRUE,Appears to be a peer-reviewed article describing a cost-effectiveness model.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Model compares interventions with cost and QALY outcomes.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['cost', 'qaly', 'clinical']",0.9,TRUE,Model evaluates cost-effectiveness of prevention policies.,Prevention,Prevention,0.9
J545,2019,"Estimating the cost-effectiveness of salt reformulation and increasing access to leisure centres in England, with PRIMEtime CE model validation using the AdViSHE tool","BACKGROUND: PRIMEtime CE is a multistate life table model that can directly compare the cost effectiveness of public health interventions affecting diet and physical activity levels, helping to inform decisions about how to spend finite resources. This paper estimates the costs and health outcomes in England of two scenarios: reformulating salt and expanding subsidised access to leisure centres. The results are used to help validate PRIMEtime CE, following the steps outlined in the Assessment of the Validation Status of Health-Economic decision models (AdViSHE) tool. METHOD(S): The PRIMEtime CE model estimates the difference in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and difference in NHS and social care costs of modelled interventions compared with doing nothing. The salt reformulation scenario models how salt consumption would change if food producers met the 2017 UK Food Standards Agency salt reformulation targets. The leisure centre scenario models change in physical activity levels if the Birmingham Be Active scheme (where swimming pools and gym access is free to residents during defined periods) was rolled out across England. The AdViSHE tool was developed by health economic modellers and divides model validation into five parts: validation of the conceptual model, input data validation, validation of computerised model, operational validation, and other validation techniques. PRIMEtime CE is discussed in relation to each part. RESULT(S): Salt reformulation was dominant compared with doing nothing, and had a 10-year return on investment of 1.44 (0.50 to 2.94) for every 1 spent. By contrast, over 10 years the Be Active expansion would cost 727,000 (514,000 to 1,064,000) per QALY. PRIMEtime CE has good face validity of its conceptual model and has robust input data. Cross-validation produces mixed results and shows the impact of model scope, input parameters, and model structure on cost-per-QALY estimates. CONCLUSION(S): This paper illustrates how PRIMEtime CE can be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of two different public health measures affecting diet and physical activity levels. The AdViSHE tool helps to validate PRIMEtime CE, identifies some of the key drivers of model estimates, and highlights the challenges of externally validating public health economic models against independent data.",TRUE,"Study conducted in England, references NHS and UK policies.",TRUE,Study estimates NHS and social care costs.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article on cost-effectiveness of public health interventions.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative cost-effectiveness with QALYs and costs measured.,TRUE,No intervention/Do nothing,TRUE,"['cost', 'qaly', 'clinical']",0.95,TRUE,Models prevention interventions: salt reformulation and leisure access.,Prevention,Prevention,0.9
J547,2019,"Individualised screening for diabetic retinopathy: The ISDR study-a randomised controlled trial of safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness","Background: Varying the intervals in retinopathy screening informed by personal risk offers reallocation of resources to better target high risk groups and address the increasing prevalence of diabetes. However, safety data especially on extended intervals is minimal. Aim(s): To evaluate the safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness (CE) of individualized variable-interval risk-based screening in a population setting compared to usual care. Method(s): Masked 2 arm, parallel assignment, equivalence RCT (largest to date in screening) with independent trials unit monitoring in people with diabetes aged >=12 years attending screening in a single English program. Randomization was 1:1 to individualized screening (active group; 6, 12 or 24 months for high, medium and low risk) determined by a risk calculation engine using real-time local demographic, retinal and clinical data, compared with annual screening (control). CE analysis measuring NHS and societal costs took a 2-year time horizon. Finding(s): 4534 participants entered the study-after withdrawals/loss to follow-up: active 2097; control 2224. Attendance rates at first follow-up visit (primary outcome, safety) were equivalent (per protocol analysis, 5% margin): active 83.6% control 84.7% (difference 1.0, 90% CI-0.8, 2.9). STDR detection rates were non-inferior (1.5% margin): active 1.43% control 1.71% (difference-0.28, CI-0.93, 0.36). Quality of life (EQ5D5L, HUI3) was not significantly different between the groups. Incremental cost saving per person was 18.75 (NHS cost) rising to 49.96 with societal costs. A 39.3% reduction in number of appointments was seen.

J549,2019,Assessing the early impact of enhanced NHS england (NHSE) funding on footcare services,"Background: A key aim of the National Diabetes Treatment and Care Programme is to improve footcare services. In Sheffield, this investment was used primarily to expand the foot protection team (FPT) and in prevention strategies. Aim(s): To assess if there has been a benefit for patients and if the spending has been cost-effective. Method(s): Ulcer severity in patients presenting to the Multi-Disciplinary Foot Team (MDFT) (SINBAD score >3 = severe, <3 = mild) was tracked between 2013 and 2018, to determine whether the proportion of severe ulcers had declined. Cost calculations were based on the 'Economic Case for Change' paper (Marion Kerr, 2017); weekly cost of a mild ulcer-77, severe ulcer-359. Result(s): The percentage of ulcers presenting as severe from 2013-2017 (prior to additional investment) was 27%, 32%, 43%, 47% and 46% respectively. In 2018, to date, this has fallen to 36%. Our mean healing time for a mild ulcer is 12.6 weeks (974) vs a severe ulcer at 16.3 weeks (5,847). This represents an approximate reduction in the costs of managing foot ulcers from 326,000/100 patients (pre-investment) to 273,000/100 patients (post-investment), a saving of 53,000/100 patients. Approximately 500 patients with new ulcers are seen by our MDFT each year, giving a total estimated saving of 268,000. If the percentage of severe ulcers returned to the baseline of 2013 (27%), savings would total around 487,000/100 patients. Conclusion(s): These data show that, within a very short timescale, the enhanced NHSE funding and added investment in prevention strategies reduced severe ulcers, giving patients' better quality of life, shorter healing times, and is cost-effective.",TRUE,"Study conducted in UK setting, references NHS England and Sheffield.",TRUE,Study occurs in NHS settings with footcare services.,TRUE,Appears to be a peer-reviewed study.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Pre/post comparison with cost and clinical outcomes.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['cost', 'clinical', 'pro']",0.95,TRUE,Focus on prevention strategies reducing severe ulcers.,Prevention,Prevention,0.9
J551,2019,Cost effectiveness of letermovir as prophylaxis of clinically significant cytomegalovirus reactivation and disease in adult CMV-seropositive allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant: A Scottish payer perspective,"Background: Data from a recent phase III clinical trial has demonstrated the efficacy of letermovir as prophylaxis against CMV reactivation in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT). The objective of this cost-effectiveness analysis is to evaluate the clinical and economic value of letermovir when compared to pre-emptive treatment from the payer perspective in Scotland. Method(s): A decision-analytic model evaluated total costs and lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALY's) from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and social work in Scotland. Efficacy data, including rates of preemptive therapy for CMV infection, CMV disease, rehospitalization, mortality, and quality of life were incorporated from clinical trial data at 24 weeks posttransplant. The primary endpoint of the trial was clinically significant CMV-infection at week 24 post-transplant. Costs of preemptive treatment, CMV disease, and other trial outcomes were obtained from published sources. Life-years during the first 24 weeks were estimated from the mortality observed in the clinical trial. Life-years post 24 weeks were estimated for the week 24 survivors by applying a relative risk of death for HSCT to the general mortality risk from the life tables for Scotland (2014-16). Utility values were applied based on EQ-5D data collected in the clinical trial and longer-term data from published sources. The annual cost to treat 1-year survivors was based on a proportion of patients receiving 2 years of immunosuppressive agent treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease (onset 100 days after transplant). Sensitivity analysis explored the impact of including data from the extended follow-up period, where various endpoints were collected through 48 weeks post-transplant. The model used an annual discount rate of 3.5%. Result(s): In the base-case analysis, letermovir reduced the number CMV infections requiring pre-emptive treatment vs standard of care (SoC) (20.0% vs 49.3%) at 24 weeks posttransplant. Prophylaxis with letermovir resulted in lower allcause mortality at week 24 in comparison to SoC (10.2% vs. 15.9%), and a mean increase in life-years (+0.46), QALY's (+0.41) and total costs up to week 24 post-HSCT per patient. This resulted in an incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) of 12,659 per QALY gained. The sensitivity analysis using data from 48 weeks posttransplant did not have a significant effect on the results. Results of a probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that letermovir was cost effective in 77.4% of iterations at 20,000 per QALY gained and 87.6% of iterations at 30,000 per QALY gained. Conclusion(s): The results of this model would suggest that the prophylaxis use of letermovir is a cost-effective treatment strategy at commonly accepted ICER thresholds. The model inputs with a greatest impact on the results were a reduction in the rate of mortality, increasing the age of patients treated with letermovir, and an increase in the cost of prophylaxis for letermovir.",TRUE,Study conducted from a Scottish payer perspective and NHS Scotland.,TRUE,Study evaluates NHS cost-effectiveness for CMV prophylaxis in transplant patients.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed cost-effectiveness analysis article.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative cost-effectiveness analysis with primary outcomes on cost and clinical impact.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,"['cost', 'qaly', 'clinical', 'pro']",0.95,TRUE,Evaluates prophylaxis to prevent CMV reactivation in HSCT patients.,Prevention,Prevention,1
J552,2019,PharmacyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased management for depression in adults,"- Background It is common for people not to take antidepressant medication as prescribed, with around 50% of people likely to prematurely discontinue taking their medication after six months. Community pharmacists may be well placed to have a role in antidepressant management because of their unique pharmacotherapeutic knowledge and ease of access for people. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to offer proactive interventions to people with depression or depressive symptoms. However, the effectiveness and acceptability of existing pharmacistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased interventions is not yet well understood. The degree to which a pharmacyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased management approach might be beneficial, acceptable to people, and effective as part of the overall management for those with depression is, to date, unclear. A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) will help answer these questions and add important knowledge to the currently sparse evidence base. Objectives To examine the effects of pharmacyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased management interventions compared with active control (e.g. patient information materials or any other active intervention delivered by someone other than the pharmacist or the pharmacy team), waiting list, or treatment as usual (e.g. standard pharmacist advice or antidepressant education, signposting to support available in primary care services, brief medication counselling, and/or (selfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â)monitoring of medication adherence offered by a healthcare professional outside the pharmacy team) at improving depression outcomes in adults. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂCTR) to June 2016; the Cochrane Library (Issue 11, 2018); and Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO to December 2018. We searched theses and dissertation databases and international trial registers for unpublished/ongoing trials. We applied no restrictions on date, language, or publication status to the searches. Selection criteria We included all RCTs and clusterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂRCTs where a pharmacyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased intervention was compared with treatment as usual, waiting list, or an alternative intervention in the management of depression in adults over 16 years of age. Eligible studies had to report at least one of the following outcomes at any time point: depression symptom change, acceptability of the intervention, diagnosis of depression, nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âadherence to medication, frequency of primary care appointments, quality of life, social functioning, or adverse events. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently, and in duplicate, conducted all stages of study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment (including GRADE). We discussed disagreements within the team until we reached consensus. Where data did not allow metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalyses, we synthesised results narratively. Main results Twelve studies (2215 participants) met the inclusion criteria and compared pharmacyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased management with treatment as usual. Two studies (291 participants) also included an active control (both used patient information leaflets providing information about the prescribed antidepressant). Neither of these studies reported depression symptom change. A narrative synthesis of results on acceptability of the intervention was inconclusive, with one study reporting better acceptability of pharmacyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased management and the other better acceptability of the active control. One study reported that participants in the pharmacyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased management group had better medication adherence than the control participants. One study reported adverse events with no difference between groups. The studies reported no other outcomes. MetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalyses comparing pharmacyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased management with treatment as usual showed no evidence of a difference in the effect of the intervention on depression symptom change (dichotomous data; improvement in symptoms yes/no: risk ratio (RR), 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 4 RCTs, 475 participants; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence; continuous data: standard mean difference (SMD) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.04, 95%",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Pharmacy-based management implies community health setting.,TRUE,"Systematic review of RCTs, likely peer-reviewed.",Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,RCTs with comparators and primary outcomes on impact.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,"['clinical', 'pro', 'safety']",0.9,TRUE,Pharmacy-based management shifts care to community setting.,Community,Community,0.9

J556,2019,Low Back and Radicular Pain Including Symptomatic Spinal Stenosis,"Back pain is the largest single cause of disability in the UK, with lower back pain alone accounting for 11% of the total disability of the UK population. Currently there is enormous geographical variation in the pathways, costs and outcomes of patients with back pain. Despite existing evidence there are a significant number of treatments with low clinical value still in use. The NHS England Trauma Programme of Care Board selected Low Back Pain and Radicular Pain as a pathfinder project in 2013. A clinical group of 30 stakeholder representatives worked collaboratively to produce an agreed, seamless pathway, extending from first contact in primary care through to secondary care and specialist services. This pathway was updated in 2017 following the publication of NICE NG59 and is endorsed in the 2019 GIRFT report. The National Back and Radicular Pain Pathway (NBRPP) is recognised as the commissioning pathway of choice for CCG's. Implementation of the NBRPP is currently being driven through Right Care and GIRFT. National Back and Radicular Pain Pathway.

J558,2019,Conservative interventions for treating functional daytime urinary incontinence in children,"- Background In children, functional daytime urinary incontinence is the term used to describe any leakage of urine while awake that is not the result of a known underlying neurological or congenital anatomic cause (such as conditions or injuries that affect the nerves that control the bladder or problems with the way the urinary system is formed). It can result in practical difficulties for both the child and their family and can have detrimental effects on a childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbeing, education and social engagement. Objectives To assess the effects of conservative interventions for treating functional daytime urinary incontinence in children. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains studies identified from CENTRAL, MEDLINE, MEDLINE InÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂProcess, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 11 September 2018). We also searched Chinese language bibliographic databases: Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang. No language restrictions were imposed. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârandomised, multiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âarm studies, crossÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âover studies and clusterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârandomised studies that included children aged between 5 and 18 years with functional daytime urinary incontinence. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened records and determined the eligibility of studies for inclusion according to predefined criteria. Where data from the study were not provided, we contacted the study authors to request further information. Two review authors assessed risk of bias and processed included study data as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions . Where metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis was possible, we applied randomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffects metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis using the MantelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHaenszel method for dichotomous outcomes. Main results The review included 27 RCTs involving 1803 children. Of these, six were multiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âarm and one was also a crossÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âover study. Most studies were small, with numbers randomised ranging from 16 to 202. A total of 19 studies were at high risk of bias for at least one domain. Few studies reported data suitable for pooling due to heterogeneity in interventions, outcomes and measurements. Individual conservative interventions (lifestyle, behavioural or physical) versus no treatment Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) versus sham (placebo) TENS. M ore children receiving active TENS may achieve continence (risk ratio (RR) 4.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.68 to 14.21; 3 studies; n = 93; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). One individual conservative intervention versus another individual or combined conservative intervention Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with urotherapy versus urotherapy alone. We are uncertain whether more children receiving PFMT with urotherapy achieve continence (RR 2.36, 95% CI 0.65 to 8.53, 95% CI 25 to 100; 3 studies; n = 91; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Voiding education with uroflowmetry feedback and urotherapy versus urotherapy alone. Slightly more children receiving voiding education with uroflow feedback and urotherapy may achieve continence (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.45; 3 studies; n = 151; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Urotherapy with timer watch versus urotherapy alone. We are uncertain whether urotherapy plus timer watch increases the number of children achieving continence compared to urotherapy alone (RR 1.42, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.80; 1 study; n = 58; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Combined conservative interventions versus other combined conservative interventions TENS and standard urotherapy versus PFMT with electromyographic biofeedback and standard urotherapy. We are uncertain whether there is any evidence of a difference between treatment groups in the proportions of children achieving continence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.68; 1 study; n = 78; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). PFMT with electr myography biofeedback and standard urotherapy versus PFMT without feedback but with standard urotherapy. We are uncertain whether there is any evidence of a difference between treatment groups in the proportions of children achieving continence (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.52; 1 study; n = 41; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Individual conservative interventions versus nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âconservative interventions (pharmacological or invasive, combined or not with any conservative interventions) PFMT versus anticholinergics. We are uncertain whether more children receiving PFMT than anticholinergics achieve continence (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.15; equivalent to an increase from 33 to 64 per 100 children; 2 studies; n = 86; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). TENS versus anticholinergics. We are uncertain whether there was any evidence of a difference between treatment groups in the proportions of children achieving continence (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.05 to 12.50; 2 studies; n = 72; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Combined conservative interventions versus nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âconservative interventions (pharmacological or invasive, combined or not with any conservative interventions) Voiding education with uroflowmetry feedback versus anticholinergics. We are uncertain whether there was any evidence of a difference between treatment groups in the proportion of children achieving continence (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.78; 1 study; n = 64; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions The review found little reliable evidence that can help affected children, their carers and the clinicians working with them to make evidenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased treatment decisions. In this scenario, the clinical experience of individual clinicians and the support of carers may be the most valuable resources. More wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdesigned research, with wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdefined interventions and consistent outcome measurement, is needed. Plain language summary Conservative (nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmaceutical and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âsurgical) treatments for children who have daytime urinary incontinence Background Many children continue to have daytime wetting accidents (urinary incontinence) long after most become dry, some into teenage years. When there is no known cause, it is referred to as functional daytime urinary incontinence. Daytime wetting can be a practical problem for the child and their carers, leading to additional laundry, expenses on absorbent pads or underwear, wet or stained furnishings and difficulties attending school or travelling. It can also lead to emotional stress, poor school attendance and performance, difficulties with social activities and making friends, and even depression and behaviour problems. Finding an effective treatment can improve the quality of life of children and their carers. Review question Children, their carers, doctors and nurses may want to avoid treatments that involve drugs or surgery, at least until they have tried treatments that do not involve these. In this review researchers brought together the results of studies conducted around the world to combine the evidence and assess which treatment(s) are most effective for managing daytime urinary incontinence in children. How upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdate is this review? The evidence is current to 11 September 2018. Study characteristics and funding sources The review identified 27 studies involving 1803 children. Twelve studies declared funding from outside sources. One of these was funded by Astellas Pharma, while another study was provided with special batches of placebo and medication free of charge, as well as materials for pad tests free of charge from another company. Certainty of evidence Cochrane Reviews assess the 'certainty' or reliability of the evidence using standardised methods that consider the way studies were designed, conducted and reported, differences between studies or populations, and the combined results of studies. Most of the studies identified for this review were small and many were poorly designed and not reported clearly. Most of the evidence was considered to be of very low certainty, meaning that little can be sa d with any certainty about the effectiveness of treatments. Key results Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may be more effective than no treatment for ending or reducing daytime wetting. We are uncertain whether urotherapy (behavioural programmes in which children ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and sometimes carers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â are taught about how the bladder works, proper toileting postures and methods, scheduled toileting, and planning what and how much to drink) is more effective when supplemented with PFMT, voiding education with feedback, or watches with alarms set to remind children when to go to the toilet. We are uncertain whether feedback that shows children how their muscles are working or how their bladder is emptying improves the effectiveness of TENS with urotherapy compared to PFMT plus feedback and urotherapy. We are also uncertain whether PFMT and urotherapy plus feedback improves the effectiveness of PFMT and urotherapy alone. We are uncertain whether pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) or TENS are more effective than anticholinergics (drugs that can reduce signals from the brain that cause the bladder to contract and empty). We are uncertain whether voiding education plus uroflowmetry (a test to measure the volume of urine) and feedback increases the number of continent children compared to anticholinergics. No serious adverse events were reported that were considered to be related to study treatments. Most nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âserious adverse events and side effects were mild or moderate in severity and were in children receiving pharmaceutical interventions. These included common pharmaceutical side effects such as nausea, abdominal pain, dry mouth, drowsiness and headache. Authors' conclusions There is a lack of goodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality research evidence that can help children, their carers and doctors and nurses to make decisions about treatments. More wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdesigned research may provide much needed evidence about the effectiveness of promising interventions in children with daytime urinary incontinence, such as TENS, PFMT and timers on watches (or mobile phones) to remind children about toileting schedules. However, it is hoped that this review will draw attention to the need for research into effective treatments for daytime wetting in children.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Study likely in community health settings due to urotherapy and interventions for children.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article from Cochrane Review.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative RCTs with clinical outcomes,TRUE,Placebo,TRUE,['clinical'],0.9,TRUE,Focus on preventing urinary incontinence complications in children.,Prevention,Prevention,0.9
J561,2019,Dietary interventions for adult cancer survivors,"- Background International dietary recommendations include guidance on healthy eating and weight management for people who have survived cancer; however dietary interventions are not provided routinely for people living beyond cancer. Objectives To assess the effects of dietary interventions for adult cancer survivors on morbidity and mortality, changes in dietary behaviour, body composition, healthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated quality of life, and clinical measurements. Search methods We ran searches on 18 September 2019 and searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via Ovid; Embase via Ovid; the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). We searched other resources including reference lists of retrieved articles, other reviews on the topic, the International Trials Registry for ongoing trials, metaRegister, Physicians Data Query, and appropriate websites for ongoing trials. We searched conference abstracts and WorldCat for dissertations. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that recruited people following a cancer diagnosis. The intervention was any dietary advice provided by any method including group sessions, telephone instruction, written materials, or a webÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased approach. We included comparisons that could be usual care or written information, and outcomes measured included overall survival, morbidities, secondary malignancies, dietary changes, anthropometry, quality of life (QoL), and biochemistry. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Two people independently assessed titles and fullÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âtext articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. For analysis, we used a randomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffects statistical model for all metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalyses, and the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence, considering limitations, indirectness, inconsistencies, imprecision, and bias. Main results We included 25 RCTs involving 7259 participants including 977 (13.5%) men and 6282 (86.5%) women. Mean age reported ranged from 52.6 to 71 years, and range of age of included participants was 23 to 85 years. The trials reported 27 comparisons and included participants who had survived breast cancer (17 trials), colorectal cancer (2 trials), gynaecological cancer (1 trial), and cancer at mixed sites (5 trials). For overall survival, dietary intervention and control groups showed little or no difference in risk of mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 1.23; 1 study; 3107 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). For secondary malignancies, dietary interventions versus control trials reported little or no difference (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.15; 1 study; 3107 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). CoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmorbidities were not measured in any included trials. Subsequent outcomes reported after 12 months found that dietary interventions versus control probably make little or no difference in energy intake at 12 months (mean difference (MD) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â59.13 kcal, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â159.05 to 37.79; 5 studies; 3283 participants; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Dietary interventions versus control probably led to slight increases in fruit and vegetable servings (MD 0.41 servings, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.71; 5 studies; 834 participants; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence); mixed results for fibre intake overall (MD 5.12 g, 95% CI 0.66 to 10.9; 2 studies; 3127 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence); and likely improvement in Diet Quality Index (MD 3.46, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.38; 747 participants; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). For anthropometry, dietary intervention versus control probably led to a slightly decreased body mass index (BMI) (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.79 kg/mÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â², 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â1.50 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.07; 4 studies; 777 participants; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Dietary interventions versus control probably had little or no effect on waistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhip ratio (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.01, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.04 to 0.02; 2 studies; 106 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). For QoL, there were mixed results; several different quality assessment tools were used and evidence was of low to very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty. No adverse events were reported in any of the included studies. Authors' conclusions Evidence demonstrated little effects of dietary interventions on overall mortality and secondary cancers. For comorbidities, no evidence was identified. For nutritional outcomes, there was probably little or no effect on energy intake, although probably a slight increase in fruit and vegetable intake and Diet Quality Index. Results were mixed for fibre. For anthropometry, there was probably a slight decrease in body mass index (BMI) but probably little or no effect on waistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhip ratio. For QoL, results were highly varied. Additional highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality research is needed to examine the effects of dietary interventions for different cancer sites, and to evaluate important outcomes including comorbidities and body composition. Evidence on new technologies used to deliver dietary interventions was limited. Plain language summary Dietary intake in people living beyond cancer Background ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ Diet has been linked to cancer, and dietary guidelines are available for cancer prevention. People after cancer have been found to have higher rates of other conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other cancers. It is therefore sensible for people after cancer to look at changing their diet. It was important to undertake this review to assess the evidence on dietary advice for people who have survived cancer. Aim of the review ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ This review evaluates evidence on dietary interventions for people after cancer. Quality of evidence ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ The quality of evidence is generally low to very low. Most studies did not evaluate dietary interventions for key review outcomes, particularly mortality and morbidity. However, a few study outcomes with moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence focused on dietary intake and physical measurements. Included studies compared dietary interventions versus control or usual care. We pooled data from similar randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to provide a summary estimate of the effects of an intervention, and we judged how confident (certain) we were of these findings by using an established method (GRADE). Main findings ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ We identified 25 RCTs involving 27 different comparisons. For some outcomes, we found absence of evidence for dietary interventions. We found some evidence showing that dietary interventions probably did not modify energy intake; however, some evidence shows what is probably a slight increase in fruit and vegetable intake (moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence ) . Evidence on dietary fibre was mixed for different advice on weight reducing or healthy eating. Dietary interventions compared to control probably improved the Diet Quality Index (moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence ) . For physical measurements, we found a probable reduction in body mass index (BMI) with dietary interventions compared to controls (moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence) but little evidence showing any change in waistÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhip ratio (lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence ) . For quality of life (QoL), results were mixed due to the wide variety of tools used. No adverse events were reported. Conclusion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ Available evidence shows that dietary interventions can be helpful in modifying fruit and vegetable servings and diet quality; modification of fibre intake was variable, and some benefits were seen for anthropometric measurements, including BMI. Most of the evidence is based on women with breast cancer, so more research is needed for patients with other cancers.

J571,2019,Alternative community-based models of care for young people with anorexia nervosa: the CostED national surveillance study,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: Evidence suggests that investing in specialist eating disorders services for young people with anorexia nervosa could have important implications for the NHS, with the potential to improve health outcomes and reduce costs through reductions in the number and length of hospital admissions.
<b>OBJECTIVES</b>: The primary objectives were to evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of alternative community-based models of service provision for young people with anorexia nervosa and to model the impact of potential changes to the provision of specialist services.
<b>DESIGN</b>: Observational surveillance study using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Surveillance System.
<b>SETTING</b>: Community-based secondary or tertiary child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
<b>PARTICIPANTS</b>: A total of 298 young people aged 8-17 years in contact with CAMHS for a first episode of anorexia nervosa in accordance with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnostic criteria.
<b>INTERVENTIONS</b>: Community-based specialist eating disorders services and generic CAMHS.
<b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</b>: Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) score (primary outcome) and percentage of median expected body mass index (BMI) for age and sex (%mBMI) (secondary outcome) were assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.
<b>DATA SOURCES</b>: Data were collected by clinicians from clinical records.
<b>RESULTS</b>: Total costs incurred by young people initially assessed in specialist eating disorders services were not significantly different from those incurred by young people initially assessed in generic CAMHS. However, adjustment for baseline covariates resulted in observed differences favouring specialist services (costs were lower, on average) because of the significantly poorer clinical status of the specialist group at baseline. At the 6-month follow-up, mean %mBMI was significantly higher in the specialist group, but no other significant differences in outcomes were evident. Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that initial assessment in a specialist service has a higher probability of being cost-effective than initial assessment in generic CAMHS, as determined by CGAS score and %mBMI. However, no firm conclusion can be drawn without knowledge of society's willingness to pay for improvements in these outcomes. Decision modelling did not support the hypothesis that changes to the provision of specialist services would generate savings for the NHS, with results suggesting that cost per 10-point improvement in CGAS score (improvement from one CGAS category to the next) varies little as the percentage of participants taking the specialist or generic pathway is varied.
<b>LIMITATIONS</b>: Follow-up rates were lower than expected, but the sample was still larger than has been achieved to date in RCTs carried out in this population in the UK, and an exploration of the impact of missing cost and outcome data produced very similar results to those of the main analyses.
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: The results of this study suggest that initial assessment in a specialist eating disorders service for young people with anorexia nervosa may have a higher probability of being cost-effective than initial assessment in generic CAMHS, although the associated uncertainty makes it hard to draw firm conclusions. Although costs and outcomes were similar, young people in specialist services were more severely ill at baseline, suggesting that specialist services were achieving larger clinical effectiveness gains without the need for additional expenditure. The results did not suggest that providing more specialist services would save money for the NHS, given similar costs and outcomes, so decisions about which service type to fund could be made with reference to other factors, such as the preferences of patients and carers.
<b>FUTURE WORK</b>: Data on measures of quality of life capable of generating quality-adjusted life-years are needed to confirm the cost-effectiveness of specialist services.

J574,2019,Abstract 2415: Polygenic risk-tailored screening for prostate cancer: A costeffectiveness Analysis,"Background Screening for prostate cancer with prostate specific antigen (PSA) remains controversial. Risk-tailoring based on age and polygenic profile might conserve the benefits of PSA screening whilst reducing overdiagnosis. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness and benefit-to-harm balance of polygenic risk-tailored screening for prostate cancer. Methods A life-table approach was used. A hypothetical cohort of 4.48 million men in England between the ages of 55 and 70 was followed to the age of 90. Three scenarios were compared: No screening, age-based screening (PSA testing every four years from 55 to 70), and risk-tailored screening based on age and polygenic risk profile (men above the risk threshold receive PSA testing four-yearly from the age they reach the risk threshold to 70). The number of prostate cancer cases, deaths from prostate cancer, overdiagnosed cases, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost per QALY, and net monetary benefit were calculated. Sensitivity analyses investigated the impact of parameter uncertainty, and the impact of varying the risk threshold, on outcomes. Costs were estimated from the perspective of the UK National Health Service; both costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. Results The incremental cost per additional QALY for age-based screening compared to no screening was 58,254 ($75,899), with 27% simulations having an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than 20,000 ($26,058), the threshold set by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for an intervention to be considered costeffective. In risk-tailored screening, as the 10-year absolute risk-threshold was progressively increased from 2.6%, equivalent to the 10-year absolute risk of a 55-year old man, to 7.1%, the corresponding risk of a 69-year old man, the cost per additional QALY gained reduced from 36,065 ($46,989) to 26,210 ($34,149), when compared to no screening. By comparison with age-based screening, risk-tailored screening with a threshold between 2.6% and 7.1% led to 8 (2.5%) and 45 (13%) fewer deaths prevented from prostate cancer per 10,000 men, with a 0.1% rise and 10% reduction in costs, respectively. Raising the risk threshold from 2.6% to 7.1% led to fewer men being screened (cumulative total of 35% of men screened by comparison with 83%), 53% fewer overdiagnosed cases, 22% fewer biopsies and 10% lower costs, at the expense of 10% fewer prostate cancer deaths averted. Conclusion Risk-tailored screening reduces the harms of screening for prostate cancer whilst preserving much of the mortality benefit. This study raises the prospect of risktailored population-based screening for prostate cancer; the precise risk-thresholds selected will depend on societal judgements regarding the appropriate trade-offs between harms and benefits.",TRUE,Study conducted in England and uses NHS data.,TRUE,Study evaluates screening in NHS context.,TRUE,"Appears to be a conference abstract, a form of grey literature.",Grey literature,0.9,TRUE,Comparative cost-effectiveness analysis with primary outcomes on cost and impact.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['cost', 'qaly', 'clinical', 'safety']",0.95,TRUE,Evaluates risk-tailored screening to prevent prostate cancer.,Prevention,Prevention,1
J575,2019,Polygenic risk-tailored screening for prostate cancer: A benefit-harm and cost-effectiveness modelling study,"Background The United States Preventive Services Task Force supports individualised decision-making for prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening in men aged 55-69. Knowing how the potential benefits and harms of screening vary by an individual's risk of developing prostate cancer could inform decision-making about screening at both an individual and population level. This modelling study examined the benefit-harm tradeoffs and the cost-effectiveness of a risk-tailored screening programme compared to age-based and no screening. Methods and findings A life-table model, projecting age-specific prostate cancer incidence and mortality, was developed of a hypothetical cohort of 4.48 million men in England aged 55 to 69 years with follow-up to age 90. Risk thresholds were based on age and polygenic profile. We compared no screening, age-based screening (quadrennial PSA testing from 55 to 69), and risk-tailored screening (men aged 55 to 69 years with a 10-year absolute risk greater than a threshold receive quadrennial PSA testing from the age they reach the risk threshold). The analysis was undertaken from the health service perspective, including direct costs borne by the health system for risk assessment, screening, diagnosis, and treatment. We used probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account for parameter uncertainty and discounted future costs and benefits at 3.5% per year. Our analysis should be considered cautiously in light of limitations related to our model's cohort-based structure and the uncertainty of input parameters in mathematical models. Compared to no screening over 35 years follow-up, age-based screening prevented the most deaths from prostate cancer (39,272, 95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 16,792-59,685) at the expense of 94,831 (95% UI: 84,827-105,630) overdiagnosed cancers. Age-based screening was the least cost-effective strategy studied. The greatest number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was generated by risk-based screening at a 10-year absolute risk threshold of 4%. At this threshold, risk-based screening led to one-third fewer overdiagnosed cancers (64,384, 95% UI: 57,382-72,050) but averted 6.3% fewer (9,695, 95% UI: 2,853-15,851) deaths from prostate cancer by comparison with age-based screening. Relative to no screening, risk-based screening at a 4% 10-year absolute risk threshold was cost-effective in 48.4% and 57.4% of the simulations at willingness-to-pay thresholds of GBP20,000 (US$26,000) and 30,000 ($39,386) per QALY, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of risk-tailored screening improved as the threshold rose. Conclusions Based on the results of this modelling study, offering screening to men at higher risk could potentially reduce overdiagnosis and improve the benefit-harm tradeoff and the cost-effectiveness of a prostate cancer screening program. The optimal threshold will depend on societal judgements of the appropriate balance of benefits-harms and cost-effectiveness. Copyright: Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2019 Callender et al.

J583,2019,Community pharmacy personnel interventions for smoking cessation,"- Background Community pharmacists could provide effective smoking cessation treatment because they offer easy access to members of the community. They are well placed to provide both advice on the correct use of smoking cessation products and behavioural support to aid smoking cessation. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of interventions delivered by community pharmacy personnel to assist people to stop smoking, with or without concurrent use of pharmacotherapy. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register, along with clinicaltrials.gov and the ICTRP, for smoking cessation studies conducted in a community pharmacy setting, using the search terms pharmacist* or pharmacy or pharmacies. Date of the most recent search: January 2019. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of interventions delivered by community pharmacy personnel to promote smoking cessation amongst their clients who were smokers, compared with usual pharmacy support or any less intensive programme. The main outcome measure was smoking cessation rates at six months or more after the start of the intervention. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane for study screening, data extraction and management. We conducted a metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis using a MantelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHaenszel randomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffects model to generate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results We identified seven studies including 1774 participants. We judged three studies to be at high risk of bias and four to be at unclear risk. Each study provided faceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âface behavioural support delivered by pharmacy staff, and required pharmacy personnel training. Typically such programmes comprised support starting before quit day and continuing with weekly appointments for several weeks afterwards. Comparators were either minimal or less intensive behavioural support for smoking cessation, typically comprising a few minutes of oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âoff advice on how to quit. Participants in both intervention and control arms received equivalent smoking cessation pharmacotherapy in all but one study. All studies took place in highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âincome countries, and recruited participants visiting pharmacies. We pooled six studies of 1614 participants and detected a benefit of more intensive behavioural smoking cessation interventions delivered by community pharmacy personnel compared with less intensive cessation interventions at longest followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup (RR 2.30, 95% CI 1.33 to 3.97; I 2 = 54%; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Community pharmacists can provide effective behavioural support to people trying to stop smoking. However, this conclusion is based on lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, limited by risk of bias and imprecision. Further research could change this conclusion. Plain language summary Does quitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âsmoking support delivered by community pharmacy staff help people to stop smoking? Background Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disease worldwide. Community pharmacists are respected healthcare professionals who provide easily accessible and convenient healthcare services to their communities, and they are well placed to provide their clients with help to quit smoking. Indeed, many governments recognise community pharmacies as a useful way of delivering many healthcare services. However, we need evidence that these services are effective before we develop them more widely. Study characteristics We searched for relevant studies in January 2019, and found seven studies including 1774 people. Three studies took place in the UK, and one each in Australia, United States, Qatar, and Italy. Each study provided faceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âface behavioural support delivered by pharmacy staff, who received specific training. Studies compared the structured programme to less intensive support to stop smoking. Key results We found evidence that more intensive structured care given by community pharmacy staff probably helps more people to quit smoking than less intensive support to quit. Qualit of the evidence We found lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence that community pharmacy support helps people to quit smoking. Limitations of the evidence came from potential problems with the ways some of the studies were carried out and the low numbers of people who quit smoking across the included studies, which means we are not sure how effective these programmes really are.",TRUE,Three studies conducted in the UK.,TRUE,Study occurs in community pharmacy settings.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article assessing smoking cessation interventions.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Randomised controlled trials with clinical outcomes.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,['clinical'],0.95,TRUE,Community pharmacy interventions for smoking cessation.,Community,Community; Prevention,0.9
J598,2019,A modelling study of the budget impact of improved glycaemic control in adults with Type 1 diabetes in the UK,"Aims: To develop a novel interactive budget impact model that assesses affordability of diabetes treatments in specific populations, and to test the model in a hypothetical scenario by estimating cost savings resulting from reduction in HbA<inf>1c</inf> from >=69 mmol/mol (8.5%) to a target of 53 mmol/mol (7.0%) in adults with Type 1 diabetes in the UK. Method(s): A dynamic, interactive model was created using the projected incidence and progression over a 5-year horizon of diabetes-related complications (micro- and macrovascular disease, severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis) for different HbA<inf>1c</inf> levels, with flexible input of population size, complications and therapy costs, HbA<inf>1c</inf> distribution and other variables. The model took a National Health Service and societal perspective. Result(s): The model was developed, and in the proposed hypothetical situation, reductions in complications and expected costs evaluated. Achievement of target HbA<inf>1c</inf> in individuals with HbA<inf>1c</inf> >=69 mmol/mol (8.5%) would reduce expected chronic complications from 6.8 to 1.2 events per 100 person-years, and diabetic ketoacidosis from 14.5 to 1.0 events per 100 person-years. Potential cumulative direct cost savings achievable in the modelled population were estimated at 687 m over 5 years (5,585/person), with total (direct and indirect) savings of 1,034 m (8,400/person). Conclusion(s): Implementation of strategies aimed at achieving target glucose levels in people with Type 1 diabetes in the UK has the potential to drive a significant reduction in complication costs. This estimate may provide insights into the potential for investment in achieving savings through improved diabetes care in the UK.

J2833,2021,Mobile phoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased interventions for improving adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults,"- Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of disability and mortality globally. Premature fatal and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âfatal CVD is considered to be largely preventable through the control of risk factors by lifestyle modifications and preventive medication. LipidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âlowering and antihypertensive drug therapies for primary prevention are costÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffective in reducing CVD morbidity and mortality among highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârisk people and are recommended by international guidelines. However, adherence to medication prescribed for the prevention of CVD can be poor. Approximately 9% of CVD cases in the EU are attributed to poor adherence to vascular medications. LowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcost, scalable interventions to improve adherence to medications for the primary prevention of CVD have potential to reduce morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs associated with CVD. Objectives To establish the effectiveness of interventions delivered by mobile phone to improve adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD in adults. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases on 7 January 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers on 5 February 2020. We searched reference lists of relevant papers. We applied no language or date restrictions. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials investigating interventions delivered wholly or partly by mobile phones to improve adherence to cardiovascular medications prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD. We only included trials with a minimum of oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âyear followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup in order that the outcome measures related to longerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm, sustained medication adherence behaviours and outcomes. Eligible comparators were usual care or control groups receiving no mobile phoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdelivered component of the intervention. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The main outcomes of interest were objective measures of medication adherence (blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol), CVD events, and adverse events. We contacted study authors for further information when this was not reported. Main results We included 14 trials with 25,633 randomised participants. Participants were recruited from communityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased primary and tertiary care or outpatient clinics. The interventions varied widely from those delivered solely through short messaging service (SMS) to those involving a combination of modes of delivery, such as SMS in addition to healthcare worker training, faceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âface counselling, electronic pillboxes, written materials, and home blood pressure monitors. Some interventions only targeted medication adherence, while others additionally targeted lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. Due to heterogeneity in the nature and delivery of the interventions and study populations, we reported most results narratively, with the exception of two trials which were similar enough to meaningfully pool in metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalyses. The body of evidence for the effect of mobile phoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased interventions on objective outcomes of adherence (BP and cholesterol) was of low certainty, due to most trials being at high risk of bias, and inconsistency in outcome effects. Two trials were at low risk of bias. Among five trials (total study enrolment: 5441 participants) recording lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂC), two studies found evidence for a small beneficial intervention effect on reducing LDLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂC (ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢5.30 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval (CI) ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢8.30 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢2.30; and ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢9.20 mg/dL, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢17.70 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢0.70). The other three studies found results varying from a small reduction (ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢7.7 mg/dL) to a small increase in LDLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂC (0.77 mg/dL). All of which had wide confidence intervals that included no effect. Across 13 studies (25,166 participants) measuring systolic blood pressure, effect estimates ranged from a large reduction (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢12.45 mmHg, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢15.02 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢9.88) to a small increase (MD 2.80 mmHg, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.30). We found a similar range of effect estimates for diastolic BP, ranging from ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢12.23 mmHg (95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢14.03 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢10.43) to 1.64 mmHg (95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢0.55 to 3.83) (11 trials, 19,716 participants). Four trials showed intervention benefits for systolic and diastolic BP with confidence intervals excluding no effect, and among these were all three of the trials evaluating selfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmonitoring of blood pressure with mobile phoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased telemedicine. The fourth trial included SMS and provider support (with additional varied features). Seven studies (19,185 participants) reported 'controlled' BP as an outcome, and intervention effect estimates varied from negligible effects (odds ratio (OR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.34) to large improvements in BP control (OR 2.41, 95% CI: 1.57 to 3.68). The three trials of clinician training or decision support combined with SMS (with additional varied features) had confidence intervals encompassing benefits and harms, with point estimates close to zero. Pooled analyses of the two trials of interventions solely delivered through SMS were indicative of little or no beneficial intervention effect on systolic BP (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢1.55 mmHg, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢3.36 to 0.25; I 2 = 0%) and small increases in controlled BP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.65; I 2 = 0%). Based on four studies (12,439 participants), there was very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision and once for risk of bias) relating to the intervention effect on combined (fatal and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âfatal) CVD events. Two studies (2535 participants) provided lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence for the effect of the intervention on cognitive outcomes, with little or no difference between trial arms for perceived quality of care and satisfaction with treatment. There was moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias) that the interventions did not cause harm, based on six studies (8285 participants). Three studies reported no adverse events attributable to the intervention. One study reported no difference between groups in experience of adverse effects of statins, and that no participants reported interventionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated adverse events. One study stated that potential side effects were similar between groups. One study reported a similar number of deaths in each arm, but did not provide further information relating to potential adverse events. Authors' conclusions There is lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence on the effects of mobile phoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdelivered interventions to increase adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD. Trials of BP selfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmonitoring with mobileÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âphone telemedicine support reported modest benefits. One trial at low risk of bias reported modest reductions in LDL cholesterol but no benefits for BP. There is moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence that these interventions do not result in harm. Further trials of these interventions are warranted. Plain language summary Interventions delivered by mobile phone to help people adhere to medication to prevent heart and circulatory disease Review question We reviewed the evidence on the effect of interventions delivered by mobile phone to help people in taking their medication to prevent cardiovascular disease (for example, heart attacks and strokes). Background Around 17.6 million people die from cardiovascular disease every year. Medications can help to prevent cardiovascular disease, but many people who have been given these medications do not take them as often or as consistently as recommended. This means that the medication will not work as well as it could to prevent cardiovascular disease. Interventions delivered through mobile phones, for example, prompting by text messaging, may be a lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcost way to help people to take their medication as recommended. Study characteristics The evidence is up to date to January 2020. We found 14 studies that tested interventions delivered at least partly by mobile phone, which followed up participants for at least 12 months. Key results We were not able to combine the results of most of the trials, because the interventions were very different. Two studies were at low risk of bias and 12 were at high risk of bias. T e effects of the interventions were inconsistent across studies, and so we are not confident about their findings. SelfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmonitoring of blood pressure plus telemedicine support by mobile phone may improve blood pressure control, but we are not confident about the findings due to trials being at risk of bias. Interventions delivered by text message alone may have little or no effect on blood pressure control. Interventions which included text messages and clinician training or clinician decision support (with or without additional features) may have little or no effect on blood pressure or cholesterol. The effects of the interventions which included text messages and provider support (with or without other features) were inconsistent across studies, and so we are not confident about their findings. We are uncertain about the effects of apps held by the patient or apps with additional provider support. Some interventions delivered by mobile phone may help people to take their medication, but the benefits are small or modest. Some trials found that the interventions did not have any beneficial effect. There was no evidence to suggest that these types of interventions caused harm.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,Study occurs in community-based primary and tertiary care or outpatient clinics.,TRUE,"Appears to be a peer-reviewed article, not a protocol or commentary.",Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,RCT with usual care comparator and clinical outcomes measured.,TRUE,Usual/Standard care,TRUE,"['clinical', 'safety']",0.95,TRUE,Mobile phone interventions for medication adherence in CVD prevention.,Prevention,Digital; Prevention,0.9
J2850,2021,Long-term monitoring in primary care for chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure: a multi-method research programme,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: Long-term monitoring is important in chronic condition management. Despite considerable costs of monitoring, there is no or poor evidence on how, what and when to monitor. The aim of this study was to improve understanding, methods, evidence base and practice of clinical monitoring in primary care, focusing on two areas: chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure.
<b>OBJECTIVES</b>: The research questions were as follows: does the choice of test affect better care while being affordable to the NHS? Can the number of tests used to manage individuals with early-stage kidney disease, and hence the costs, be reduced? Is it possible to monitor heart failure using a simple blood test? Can this be done using a rapid test in a general practitioner consultation? Would changes in the management of these conditions be acceptable to patients and carers?
<b>DESIGN</b>: Various study designs were employed, including cohort, feasibility study, Clinical Practice Research Datalink analysis, seven systematic reviews, two qualitative studies, one cost-effectiveness analysis and one cost recommendation.
<b>SETTING</b>: This study was set in UK primary care.
<b>DATA SOURCES</b>: Data were collected from study participants and sourced from UK general practice and hospital electronic health records, and worldwide literature.
<b>PARTICIPANTS</b>: The participants were NHS patients (Clinical Practice Research Datalink: 4.5 million patients), chronic kidney disease and chronic heart failure patients managed in primary care (including 750 participants in the cohort study) and primary care health professionals.
<b>INTERVENTIONS</b>: The interventions were monitoring with blood and urine tests (for chronic kidney disease) and monitoring with blood tests and weight measurement (for chronic heart failure).
<b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</b>: The main outcomes were the frequency, accuracy, utility, acceptability, costs and cost-effectiveness of monitoring.
<b>RESULTS</b>: Chronic kidney disease: serum creatinine testing has increased steadily since 1997, with most results being normal (83% in 2013). Increases in tests of creatinine and proteinuria correspond to their introduction as indicators in the Quality and Outcomes Framework. The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation had 2.7% greater accuracy (95% confidence interval 1.6% to 3.8%) than the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation for estimating glomerular filtration rate. Estimated annual transition rates to the next chronic kidney disease stage are = 2% for people with normal urine albumin, 3-5% for people with microalbuminuria (3-30 mg/mmol) and 3-12% for people with macroalbuminuria (> 30 mg/mmol). Variability in estimated glomerular filtration rate-creatinine leads to misclassification of chronic kidney disease stage in 12-15% of tests in primary care. Glycaemic-control and lipid-modifying drugs are associated with a 6% (95% confidence interval 2% to 10%) and 4% (95% confidence interval 0% to 8%) improvement in renal function, respectively. Neither estimated glomerular filtration rate-creatinine nor estimated glomerular filtration rate-Cystatin C have utility in predicting rate of kidney function change. Patients viewed phrases such as 'kidney damage' or 'kidney failure' as frightening, and the term 'chronic' was misinterpreted as serious. Diagnosis of asymptomatic conditions (chronic kidney disease) was difficult to understand, and primary care professionals often did not use 'chronic kidney disease' when managing patients at early stages. General practitioners relied on Clinical Commissioning Group or Quality and Outcomes Framework alerts rather than National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance for information. Cost-effectiveness modelling did not demonstrate a tangible benefit of monitoring kidney function to guide preventative treatments, except for individuals with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60-90 ml/minute/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, aged < 70 years and without cardiovascular disease, where monitoring every 3-4 years to guide cardiovascular prevention may be cost-effective. Chronic heart failure: natriuretic peptide-guided treatment could reduce all-cause mortality by 13% and heart failure admission by 20%. Implementing natriuretic peptide-guided treatment is likely to require predefined protocols, stringent natriuretic peptide targets, relative targets and being located in a specialist heart failure setting. Remote monitoring can reduce all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalisation, and could improve quality of life. Diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (sensitivity, 0.99; specificity, 0.60) was better than point-of-care B-type natriuretic peptide (sensitivity, 0.95; specificity, 0.57). Within-person variation estimates for B-type natriuretic peptide and weight were as follows: coefficient of variation, 46% and coefficient of variation, 1.2%, respectively. Point-of-care N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide within-person variability over 12 months was 881 pg/ml (95% confidence interval 380 to 1382 pg/ml), whereas between-person variability was 1972 pg/ml (95% confidence interval 1525 to 2791 pg/ml). For individuals, monitoring provided reassurance; future changes, such as increased testing, would be acceptable. Point-of-care testing in general practice surgeries was perceived positively, reducing waiting time and anxiety. Community heart failure nurses had greater knowledge of National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance than general practitioners and practice nurses. Health-care professionals believed that the cost of natriuretic peptide tests in routine monitoring would outweigh potential benefits. The review of cost-effectiveness studies suggests that natriuretic peptide-guided treatment is cost-effective in specialist settings, but with no evidence for its value in primary care settings.
<b>LIMITATIONS</b>: No randomised controlled trial evidence was generated. The pathways to the benefit of monitoring chronic kidney disease were unclear.
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: It is difficult to ascribe quantifiable benefits to monitoring chronic kidney disease, because monitoring is unlikely to change treatment, especially in chronic kidney disease stages G3 and G4. New approaches to monitoring chronic heart failure, such as point-of-care natriuretic peptide tests in general practice, show promise if high within-test variability can be overcome.
<b>FUTURE WORK</b>: The following future work is recommended: improve general practitioner-patient communication of early-stage renal function decline, and identify strategies to reduce the variability of natriuretic peptide.

J2855,2021,Carbapenemase-producing organism (CPO) colonisation at a district general hospital: universal screening may help reduce transmission,"Objective: Assess the potential of hospital-wide routine screening by determining the prevalence and incidence of carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) isolated from rectal screens at Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals. Method(s): 3,553 samples were collected between 01/12/2018 and 31/08/2019: from adult critical care wards (universal screening - admission, discharge and weekly), from medical wards with risk-factor based screening according to the prevailing Public Health England (PHE) carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) screening guidelines, or on an ad hoc basis. Prevalence was defined as previously documented positive CPO colonisation, or new positive status, as a proportion of all eligible samples. Incidence was defined as all newly positive patients per 1,000 patient-days. Result(s): Overall CPO prevalence was 2.1% (95% CI: 1.61-2.58%). Inpatient prevalence was significantly higher at 2.6% vs outpatient at 0.5% (p < 0.001). Incidence was 0.44 per 1,000 patient-days (95% CI: 0.33-0.57), with a rate ratio between Barnet and Chase Farm of 4.9 (p = 0.013). Incidence was highest where universal screening strategy was applied (3.9 per 1000 patient-days, 95% CI: 2.4-5.91). This was 2.5 times higher than risk-factor based screening (p = 0.005) and 23.5 times that of wards without routine surveillance implemented (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Surveillance remains a cornerstone in controlling CPO transmission. Our local incidence, lacking hospital-wide screening, significantly exceeded the reported UK average. Universal screening could help to uncover the true prevalence and incidence of CPO, thereby providing the necessary information to properly control transmission, reducing nosocomial outbreaks and ultimately reducing the overall cost to healthcare.

J2856,2021,Results of the avoiding late diagnosis of ovarian cancer (ALDO) project; A pilot national surveillance program for brca mutationcarriers,"Introduction/Background * Ovarian cancer (OC) in BRCA mutation-carriers is typically diagnosed clinically at >=stage 3c, with consequent poor prognosis. Risk-reducing salpingooophorectomy (RRSO) is recommended for BRCA mutationcarriers as the only proven method of OC prevention. Women who defer RRSO to permit child-bearing/prevent premature menopause would benefit from surveillance which can downstage OC occurring prior to RRSO. We wanted to establish the 'real world' performance of OC surveillance which we have previously shown downstages OC in clinical trials. Methodology 875 female BRCA mutation-carriers were recruited at 13 UK centres and via a media campaign and underwent 4-monthly surveillance with the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA) blood test. They had a 6 week repeat test if their ROCA score was >1 in 1000, and a transvaginal scan (TVS) in addition, if their risk was > 1 in 500. Women with a score >1 in 33 or those with concerning TVS were referred to a rapid access clinic to rule out OC. RRSO was encouraged throughout the program. Participants were followed via questionnaires, notification by centres/GPs and direct contact. Surveillance performance was calculated after censoring 4 months after prior screen, with modelling of occult cancers detected at RRSO. Incremental cost-effectiveness was calculated using a Markov population cohort simulation. Result(s)* 8 OCs occurred during 1277 women screen years; 2 occult OCs at RRSO (both stage 1a), 6 screen-detected OCs (3 prevalent; stage 2a, 3aii and 3c, 3 incident; stage 1a, 3b and 4b). 4 of 6 (67%) screen-detected OCs were diagnosed at stages <3c. 7 of 8 (87.5%) screen-detected cancers were completely cytoreduced. There were no interval cancers. Modelled sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for OC were 87.5% (CI, 47.3-99.7), 99.9%(99.9-100), 75%(34.9-96.8) and 99.9% (99.9-100) respectively. Economic modelling indicated that surveillance would be cost-saving within the UK National Health Service. Conclusion* OC surveillance for women declining RRSO in a 'real-word' setting is feasible and equally effective as in research trials, resulting in successful downstaging with likely clinical benefit and healthcare cost savings. Whilst RRSO remains the recommended management for BRCA-carriers, ROCA-based surveillance is a viable interim option for those who defer such surgery.",TRUE,Study conducted at 13 UK centres and involves NHS.,TRUE,"Study conducted in UK centres, likely NHS settings.",TRUE,Peer-reviewed research article on ovarian cancer surveillance.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Uses modelling for cost-effectiveness and measures clinical impact.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['clinical', 'cost']",0.9,TRUE,Surveillance aims to prevent late-stage ovarian cancer.,Prevention,Prevention,0.95

Various treatment options are available, but direct headÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhead comparisons do not allow comparison of all treatments versus another. Objectives ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ In adults with solid cancer or haematological malignancy receiving HEC ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â To compare the effects of antiemetic treatment combinations including NKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â receptor antagonists, 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã†â€™ receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids on prevention of acute phase (Day 1), delayed phase (Days 2 to 5), and overall (Days 1 to 5) chemotherapyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âinduced nausea and vomiting in network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis (NMA) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â To generate a clinically meaningful treatment ranking according to treatment safety and efficacy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ In adults with solid cancer or haematological malignancy receiving MEC ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â To compare whether antiemetic treatment combinations including NKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â receptor antagonists, 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã†â€™ receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids are superior for prevention of acute phase (Day 1), delayed phase (Days 2 to 5), and overall (Days 1 to 5) chemotherapyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âinduced nausea and vomiting to treatment combinations including 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã†â€™ receptor antagonists and corticosteroids solely, in network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â To generate a clinically meaningful treatment ranking according to treatment safety and efficacy Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, conference proceedings, and study registries from 1988 to February 2021 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Selection criteria We included RCTs including adults with any cancer receiving HEC or MEC (according to the latest definition) and comparing combination therapies of NKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â and 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã†â€™ inhibitors and corticosteroids for prevention of CINV. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We expressed treatment effects as risk ratios (RRs). Prioritised outcomes were complete control of vomiting during delayed and overall phases, complete control of nausea during the overall phase, quality of life, serious adverse events (SAEs), and onÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstudy mortality. We assessed GRADE and developed 12 'Summary of findings' tables. We report results of most crucial outcomes in the abstract, that is, complete control of vomiting during the overall phase and SAEs. For a comprehensive illustration of results, we randomly chose aprepitant plus granisetron as exemplary reference treatment for HEC, and granisetron as exemplary reference treatment for MEC. Main results Highly emetogenic chemotherapy ( HEC) We included 73 studies reporting on 25,275 participants and comparing 14 treatment combinations with NKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â and 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã†â€™ inhibitors. All treatment combinations included corticosteroids. Complete control of vomiting during the overall phase We estimated that 704 of 1000 participants achieve complete control of vomiting in the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when treated with aprepitant + granisetron. Evidence from NMA (39 RCTs, 21,642 participants; 12 treatment combinations with NKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â and 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã†â€™ inhibitors) suggests that the following drug combinations are more efficacious than aprepitant + granisetron for completely controlling vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days): fosnetupitant + palonosetron (810 of 1000; RR 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.37; moderate certainty), aprepitant + palonosetron (753 of 1000; RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.98 to 1.18; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty), aprepitant + ramosetron (753 of 1000; RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.21; low certainty), and fosaprepitant + palonosetron (746 of 1000; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96 to .19; low certainty). Netupitant + palonosetron (704 of 1000; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08; highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty) and fosaprepitant + granisetron (697 of 1000; RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.06; highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty) have little to no impact on complete control of vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when compared to aprepitant + granisetron, respectively. Evidence further suggests that the following drug combinations are less efficacious than aprepitant + granisetron in completely controlling vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days) (ordered by decreasing efficacy): aprepitant + ondansetron (676 of 1000; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.05; low certainty), fosaprepitant + ondansetron (662 of 1000; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04; low certainty), casopitant + ondansetron (634 of 1000; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.03; low certainty), rolapitant + granisetron (627 of 1000; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.01; moderate certainty), and rolapitant + ondansetron (598 of 1000; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.12; low certainty). We could not include two treatment combinations (ezlopitant + granisetron, aprepitant + tropisetron) in NMA for this outcome because of missing direct comparisons. Serious adverse events We estimated that 35 of 1000 participants experience any SAEs when treated with aprepitant + granisetron. Evidence from NMA (23 RCTs, 16,065 participants; 11 treatment combinations) suggests that fewer participants may experience SAEs when treated with the following drug combinations than with aprepitant + granisetron: fosaprepitant + ondansetron (8 of 1000; RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.07; low certainty), casopitant + ondansetron (8 of 1000; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.39; low certainty), netupitant + palonosetron (9 of 1000; RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.58; low certainty), fosaprepitant + granisetron (13 of 1000; RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.50; low certainty), and rolapitant + granisetron (20 of 1000; RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.70; low certainty). Evidence is very uncertain about the effects of aprepitant + ondansetron (8 of 1000; RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.14; very low certainty), aprepitant + ramosetron (11 of 1000; RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.90; very low certainty), fosaprepitant + palonosetron (12 of 1000; RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.95; very low certainty), fosnetupitant + palonosetron (13 of 1000; RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.16; very low certainty), and aprepitant + palonosetron (17 of 1000; RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.05 to 4.78; very low certainty) on the risk of SAEs when compared to aprepitant + granisetron, respectively. We could not include three treatment combinations (ezlopitant + granisetron, aprepitant + tropisetron, rolapitant + ondansetron) in NMA for this outcome because of missing direct comparisons. Moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) We included 38 studies reporting on 12,038 participants and comparing 15 treatment combinations with NKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â and 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã†â€™ inhibitors, or 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã†â€™ inhibitors solely. All treatment combinations included corticosteroids. Complete control of vomiting during the overall phase We estimated that 555 of 1000 participants achieve complete control of vomiting in the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when treated with granisetron. Evidence from NMA (22 RCTs, 7800 participants; 11 treatment combinations) suggests that the following drug combinations are more efficacious than granisetron in completely controlling vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days): aprepitant + palonosetron (716 of 1000; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.66; low certainty), netupitant + palonosetron (694 of 1000; RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.70; low certainty), and rolapitant + granisetron (660 of 1000; RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.33; high certainty). Palonosetron (588 of 1000; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.32; low certainty) and aprepitant + granisetron (577 of 1000; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.32; low certainty) may or may not increase complete response in the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when compared to granisetron, respectively. Azasetron (560 of 1000; RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.34; low certainty) may result in little to no difference in complete response in the overall treatment phase (one to five days) when compared to granisetron. Evidence further suggests that the following drug combinations are less efficacious than granisetron in completely controlling vomiting during the overall treatment phase (one to five days) (ordered by decreasing efficacy): fosaprepitant + ondansetron (500 of 1000; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.22; low certainty), aprepitant + ondansetron (477 of 1000; RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.17; low certainty), casopitant + ondansetron (461 of 1000; RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.12; low certainty), and ondansetron (433 of 1000; RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.04; low certainty). We could not include five treatment combinations (fosaprepitant + granisetron, azasetron, dolasetron, ramosetron, tropisetron) in NMA for this outcome because of missing direct comparisons. Serious adverse events We estimated that 153 of 1000 participants experience any SAEs when treated with granisetron. Evidence from pairÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âwise comparison (1 RCT, 1344 participants) suggests that more participants may experience SAEs when treated with rolapitant + granisetron (176 of 1000; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.50; low certainty). NMA was not feasible for this outcome because of missing direct comparisons. Certainty of evidence Our main reason for downgrading was serious or very serious imprecision (e.g. due to wide 95% CIs crossing or including unity, few events leading to wide 95% CIs, or small information size). Additional reasons for downgrading some comparisons or whole networks were serious study limitations due to high risk of bias or moderate inconsistency within networks. Authors' conclusions This field of supportive cancer care is very well researched. However, new drugs or drug combinations are continuously emerging and need to be systematically researched and assessed. For people receiving HEC, synthesised evidence does not suggest one superior treatment for prevention and control of chemotherapyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âinduced nausea and vomiting. For people receiving MEC, synthesised evidence does not suggest superiority for treatments including both NKÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â and 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã†â€™ inhibitors when compared to treatments including 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã†â€™ inhibitors only. Rather, the results of our NMA suggest that the choice of 5ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂHTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã†â€™ inhibitor may have an impact on treatment efficacy in preventing CINV. When interpreting the results of this systematic review, it is important for the reader to understand that NMAs are no substitute for direct headÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhead comparisons, and that results of our NMA do not necessarily rule out differences that could be clinically relevant for some individuals. Plain language summary Which drug combinations are best for prevention of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy in adults with cancer? The burden of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and what helps to prevent it? In about 70% to 80% of adults with cancer, chemotherapy induces nausea and vomiting (CINV). Depending on the type of chemotherapy, treatment can cause strong or moderate sickness (hereafter referred to as HEC (highly emetogenic chemotherapy) and MEC (moderately emetogenic chemotherapy)). Multiple drug combinations have showed high benefit for CINV among adults receiving HEC or MEC. What was the aim of our review? Using a network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis, we aimed to compare the benefits and harms of different drug combinations for prevention of CINV among people receiving HEC or MEC, and to identify treatment ranking. A network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis is a technique used to compare different treatments described in already published trials, even when the original individual trial does not describe such comparisons. What studies did we look at? We searched selected medical databases and trial registries until February 2021. We included studies comparing multiple drug combinations for prevention of CINV among adults with any type of cancer receiving HEC or MEC that is commonly used in clinical practice. In particular, we looked at drugs inhibiting two specific biochemical receptors (neurokinin receptor and serotonin receptor) that trigger nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy. We looked at the preventative effects of these treatments over five days. This is the period during which the maximum intensity of CINV and further peaks of intensity are expected, after the start of chemotherapy. Our key results... ...for people receiving HEC We found 73 studies that reported on the experience of 25,275 participants and compared 14 treatment combinations of our interest. Benefits. Over five days, investigated treatments helped to prevent any vomiting in 60% to 81% of people on average. Those individuals also had no need for rescue medicines, which are used in case nausea and vomiting occur even though prophylactic treatment has been given. The results of our analysis suggest some differences in effectiveness of different treatments, but overall we had little confidence that those differences would be reflected in realÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âworld observations. Harms. We estimated that 1% to 4% of people experience serious side effects. The differences between treatments were small. ...for people receiving MEC We found 38 studies that reported on the experience of 12,038 participants and compared 15 treatment combinations of our interest. Benefits. Over five days, investigated treatments helped prevent any vomiting in 43% to 72% of people on average. Those individuals also had no need for rescue medicines. The results of our analysis suggest some differences in the effectiveness of different treatments, but overall, we had little confidence that those differences would be reflected in realÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âworld observations. Harms. Few studies reported serious side effects. The ones that did suggest that on average 15% to 18% of people experience such events. Differences between treatments were small. However, we think that future research is needed to rule out potential differences between treatments. Our confidence in the findings We assessed how confident we were that there are differences between compared treatments. We had low or very low confidence that one treatment is better or worse than another in preventing CINV. Our confidence in differences between statistical results was mainly limited because measures of variation were wide apart and included both potential advantages and disadvantages, although measures of precision showed no or little effect. We also identified limitations in some of the included studies, which further limited our confidence in the effects. This was mainly the case when study personnel and participants knew which treatments were given and therefore may not adhere to the planned intervention, or may perceive or report effects differently. Our conclusions The results of our analysis suggest that there is no superior drug combination for prevention of CINV for people receiving HEC or MEC. However, results suggest that the choice of drugs targeting the serotonin receptor may impact effectiveness, irrespective of whether given with or without a drug targeting the neurokinin receptor. However, when interpreting these results, it is important for the reader to understand that these kinds of multipleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomparison analyses are no substitute for headÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhead comparisons, and that the results do not necessarily rule out differences that could be clinically relevant for some individuals.

J2858,2021,Secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis: a network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis,"- Background Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years of diagnosis. Several different treatments are available, which include endoscopic sclerotherapy, variceal band ligation, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), and surgical portocaval shunts, among others. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of different initial treatments for secondary prevention of variceal bleeding in adults with previous oesophageal variceal bleeding due to decompensated liver cirrhosis through a network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for secondary prevention according to their safety and efficacy. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers until December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and a previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices. Selection criteria We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had no previous history of bleeding from oesophageal varices, previous history of bleeding only from gastric varices, those who failed previous treatment (refractory bleeding), those who had acute bleeding at the time of treatment, and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation. Data collection and analysis We performed a network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR) and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an availableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcase analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. Main results We included a total of 48 randomised clinical trials (3526 participants) in the review. FortyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âsix trials (3442 participants) were included in one or more comparisons. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies. The followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup ranged from two months to 61 months. All the trials were at high risk of bias. A total of 12 interventions were compared in these trials (sclerotherapy, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers, variceal band ligation, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus sclerotherapy, no active intervention, TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt), betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus nitrates, portocaval shunt, sclerotherapy plus variceal band ligation, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus nitrates plus variceal band ligation, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy plus nitrates). Overall, 22.5% of the trial participants who received the reference treatment (chosen because this was the commonest treatment compared in the trials) of sclerotherapy died during the followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup period ranging from two months to 61 months. There was considerable uncertainty in the effects of interventions on mortality. Accordingly, none of the interventions showed superiority over another. None of the trials reported healthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated quality of life. Based on lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in fewer serious adverse events (number of people) than sclerotherapy (OR 0.19; 95% CrI 0.06 to 0.54; 1 trial; 100 participants). Based on low or very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, the adverse events (number of participants) and adverse events (number of events) may be different across many comparisons; however, these differences are due to very small trials at high risk of bias showing large differences in some comparisons leading to many differences despite absence of direct evidence. Based on lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, TIPS may result in large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation (HR 0.12; 95% CrI 0.03 to 0.41; 1 trial; 58 participants). Based on moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, any variceal rebleed was probably lower in sclerotherapy than in no active intervention (HR 0.62; 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.99, direct comparison HR 0.66; 95% CrI 0.11 to 3.13; 3 trials; 296 participants), betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus sclerotherapy than sclerotherapy alone (HR 0.60; 95% CrI 0.37 to 0.95; direct comparison HR 0.50; 95% CrI 0.07 to 2.96; 4 trials; 231 participants); TIPS than sclerotherapy (HR 0.18; 95% CrI 0.08 to 0.38; direct comparison HR 0.22; 95% CrI 0.01 to 7.51; 2 trials; 109 participants), and in portocaval shunt than sclerotherapy (HR 0.21; 95% CrI 0.05 to 0.77; no direct comparison) groups. Based on lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers alone and TIPS might result in more, other compensation, events than sclerotherapy (rate ratio 2.37; 95% CrI 1.35 to 4.67; 1 trial; 65 participants and rate ratio 2.30; 95% CrI 1.20 to 4.65; 2 trials; 109 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions including those related to betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus variceal band ligation in the remaining comparisons. Authors' conclusions The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions on mortality. Variceal band ligation might result in fewer serious adverse events than sclerotherapy. TIPS might result in a large decrease in symptomatic rebleed than variceal band ligation. Sclerotherapy probably results in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than no active intervention. BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus sclerotherapy and TIPS probably result in fewer 'any' variceal rebleeding than sclerotherapy. BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers alone and TIPS might result in more other compensation events than sclerotherapy. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons. Accordingly, highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality randomised comparative clinical trials are needed. Plain language summary Prevention of rebleeding from enlarged veins in the food pipe (oesophagus) resulting from advanced liver disease What is the aim of this Cochrane Review? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨To find out the best available preventive treatment for repeated bleeding from oesophageal varices (enlarged veins in the food pipe) in people with advanced liver disease (liver cirrhosis, or lateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstage scarring of the liver with complications). People with cirrhosis who had previously bled from oesophageal varices are at significant risk of death from another episode of bleeding. Therefore, it is important to provide preventive treatment to prevent rebleeding in such people, but the benefits and harms of different treatments available are currently unclear. The authors of this review collected and analysed all relevant randomised clinical trials with the aim of finding out the best treatment. They found 48 randomised clinical trials (studies where participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups). During analysis of data, authors used standard Cochrane methods, which allow comparison of only two treatments at a time. Authors also used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments at the same time (usually referred as 'network (or indirect) metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis'). Date of literature search ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨December 2019 Key messages ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨None of the studies were conducted without flaws, and because of this, there is moderate to very high uncertainty in the findings of this review. Approximately one in five trial participants with cirrhosis who received preventive treatment after control of initial bleeding from oesophageal varices died within five years of treatment with sclerotherapy. What was studied in the review? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨This review looked at adults of any sex, age, and ethnic origin, with advanced liver disease due to various causes and previous bleeding from oesophageal varices. Participants were given different treatments for preventing further bleeding oesophageal varices. The authors excluded studies in people who had bleeding from the stomach, who had no previous bleeding f om the oesophageal varices, those who failed to respond to another treatment before study entry, and those who had liver transplantation previously. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 40 to 63 years. The treatments used in the trials included endoscopic sclerotherapy (injecting into the enlarged veins by looking through a tube inserted through the mouth), variceal band ligation (inserting bands around the dilated veins by seeing through a tube inserted through the mouth), betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers (drugs that slow the heart and decrease the force of heart pumping resulting in decrease pressure in the blood vessels), and TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; an artificial channel that connects the different blood vessels that carry oxygenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdepleted blood (venous system)) within the liver to reduce the pressure builtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup in the portal venous system, one of the two venous systems draining the liver), portocaval shunt (performing surgery to create the artificial channel described for TIPS) among others. The review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, quality of life, serious and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âserious adverse events, recurrence of bleeding, and development of other complications of advanced liver disease.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ What were the main results of the review? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨The 48 studies included a small number of participants (3526 participants). Study data were sparse. FortyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âsix studies with 3442 participants provided data for analyses.

J2861,2021,Integrated disease management interventions for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"- Background People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) show considerable variation in symptoms, limitations, and wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbeing; this often complicates medical care. A multiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdisciplinary and multiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent programme that addresses different elements of care could improve quality of life (QoL) and exercise tolerance, while reducing the number of exacerbations. Objectives To compare the effectiveness of integrated disease management (IDM) programmes versus usual care for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in terms of healthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated quality of life (QoL), exercise tolerance, and exacerbationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated outcomes. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL for potentially eligible studies. Searches were current as of September 2020. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared IDM programmes for COPD versus usual care were included. Interventions consisted of multiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdisciplinary (two or more healthcare providers) and multiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âtreatment (two or more components) IDM programmes of at least three months' duration. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. If required, we contacted study authors to request additional data. We performed metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalyses using randomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffects modelling. We carried out sensitivity analyses for the quality of included studies and performed subgroup analyses based on setting, study design, dominant intervention components, and region. Main results Along with 26 studies included in the 2013 Cochrane Review, we added 26 studies for this update, resulting in 52 studies involving 21,086 participants for inclusion in the metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis. FollowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup periods ranged between 3 and 48 months and were classified as shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm (up to 6 months), mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm (6 to 15 months), and longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm (longer than 15 months) followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup. Studies were conducted in 19 different countries. The mean age of included participants was 67 years, and 66% were male. Participants were treated in all types of healthcare settings, including primary (n =15), secondary (n = 22), and tertiary care (n = 5), and combined primary and secondary care (n = 10). Overall, the level of certainty of evidence was moderate to high. We found that IDM probably improves healthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated QoL as measured by St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup (mean difference (MD) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â3.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â6.16 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â1.63; 18 RCTs, 4321 participants; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). A comparable effect was observed at shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â3.78, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â6.29 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â1.28; 16 RCTs, 1788 participants). However, the common effect did not exceed the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 4 points. There was no significant difference between IDM and control for longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup and for generic QoL. IDM probably also leads to a large improvement in maximum and functional exercise capacity, as measured by sixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âminute walking distance (6MWD), at mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup (MD 44.69, 95% CI 24.01 to 65.37; 13 studies, 2071 participants; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). The effect exceeded the MCID of 35 metres and was even greater at shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm (MD 52.26, 95% CI 32.39 to 72.74; 17 RCTs, 1390 participants) and longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm (MD 48.83, 95% CI 16.37 to 80.49; 6 RCTs, 7288 participants) followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup. The number of participants with respiratoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated admissions was reduced from 324 per 1000 participants in the control group to 235 per 1000 participants in the IDM group (odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.81; 15 RCTs, median followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup 12 months, 4207 participants; highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Likewise, IDM probably results in a reduction in emergency department (ED) visits (OR 0.69, 95%CI 0.50 to 0.93; 9 RCTs, median followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup 12 months, 8791 participants; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence), a slight reduction in allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcause hospital admissions (OR 0.75, 95%CI 0.57 to 0.98; 10 RCT , median followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup 12 months, 9030 participants; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence), and fewer hospital days per person admitted (MD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â2.27, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â3.98 to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.56; 14 RCTs, median followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup 12 months, 3563 participants; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Statistically significant improvement was noted on the Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnoea Scale at shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and mediumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup but not at longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup. No differences between groups were reported for mortality, courses of antibiotics/prednisolone, dyspnoea, and depression and anxiety scores. Subgroup analysis of dominant intervention components and regions of study suggested contextÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and interventionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âspecific effects. However, some subgroup analyses were marked by considerable heterogeneity or included few studies. These results should therefore be interpreted with caution. Authors' conclusions This review shows that IDM probably results in improvement in diseaseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âspecific QoL, exercise capacity, hospital admissions, and hospital days per person. Future research should evaluate which combination of IDM components and which intervention duration are most effective for IDM programmes, and should consider contextual determinants of implementation and treatment effect, including processÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated outcomes, longÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup, and costÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffectiveness analyses. Plain language summary Integrated disease management for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease What are the effects of integrated disease management (IDM) programmes on quality of life, ability to exercise, and number of lung attacks compared to usual care in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic lung disease and is a major cause of ill health worldwide. People with COPD feel the impact of the disease in their daily life through symptoms such as breathlessness and coughing and acute worsening of symptoms in lung attacks. Different healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurses, and physiotherapists, typically provide different types of care to people with COPD (e.g. prescribe medication, guide selfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmanagement, provide education, present exercise training). Previously, people with COPD could visit one or more different healthcare providers, and these providers would work independently. The goal of an integrated disease management (IDM) programme is to include different components of care by which different healthcare providers are coÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âoperating and collaborating to provide more efficient care of better quality. Study characteristics We evaluated 52 studies involving 21,086 people with COPD. These studies were conducted in 19 countries spread all over the world. The average age of participants was 67 years, and 66% of participants were men. Some studies took place in general practices, some in hospitals, and some in both settings. Key results We found that people who participate in an IDM programme probably have better quality of life and their ability to exercise is probably improved compared to those receiving usual care. It is likely that people in an IDM programme have fewer hospital admissions for lung attacks and make fewer visits to an emergency department. When hospitalised, the total number of days people have to spend in hospital is reduced by two days. IDM programmes probably do not help to reduce the number of patients who die. The variety of available programmes makes it difficult to say if one IDM programme is the best. Future studies should look at the most important components and the ideal length of the programme. Certainty of the evidence Overall, the certainty of our evidence was moderate to high but sometimes with large differences between studies.

J2881,2021,Using electronic patient records to assess the effect of a complex antenatal intervention in a cluster randomised controlled trial-data management experience from the DESiGN Trial team,"Background: The use of electronic patient records for assessing outcomes in clinical trials is a methodological strategy intended to drive faster and more cost-efficient acquisition of results. The aim of this manuscript was to outline the data collection and management considerations of a maternity and perinatal clinical trial using data from electronic patient records, exemplifying the DESiGN Trial as a case study. Method(s): The DESiGN Trial is a cluster randomised control trial assessing the effect of a complex intervention versus standard care for identifying small for gestational age foetuses. Data on maternal/perinatal characteristics and outcomes including infants admitted to neonatal care, parameters from foetal ultrasound and details of hospital activity for health-economic evaluation were collected at two time points from four types of electronic patient records held in 22 different electronic record systems at the 13 research clusters. Data were pseudonymised on site using a bespoke Microsoft Excel macro and securely transferred to the central data store. Data quality checks were undertaken. Rules for data harmonisation of the raw data were developed and a data dictionary produced, along with rules and assumptions for data linkage of the datasets. The dictionary included descriptions of the rationale and assumptions for data harmonisation and quality checks. Result(s): Data were collected on 182,052 babies from 178,350 pregnancies in 165,397 unique women. Data availability and completeness varied across research sites; each of eight variables which were key to calculation of the primary outcome were completely missing in median 3 (range 1-4) clusters at the time of the first data download. This improved by the second data download following clarification of instructions to the research sites (each of the eight key variables were completely missing in median 1 (range 0-1) cluster at the second time point). Common data management challenges were harmonising a single variable from multiple sources and categorising free-text data, solutions were developed for this trial. Conclusion(s): Conduct of clinical trials which use electronic patient records for the assessment of outcomes can be time and cost-effective but still requires appropriate time and resources to maximise data quality. A difficulty for pregnancy and perinatal research in the UK is the wide variety of different systems used to collect patient data across maternity units. In this manuscript, we describe how we managed this and provide a detailed data dictionary covering the harmonisation of variable names and values that will be helpful for other researchers working with these data.

J2886,2021,Run for Your Life: A Systematic Review of Exercise to Reduce Post Treatment Fatigue and Increase Quality of Life in Childhood Cancer Survivors,"Background and Aims: Fatigue and poor quality of life is increasingly recognised in survivors of childhood cancer. Exercise is encouraged to decrease symptoms and increase quality of life. However the literature regarding this approach is slim. We wanted to provide a robust, evidence based platform to guide health care professionals, childhood cancer survivors and their families, when trying to minimise distressing symptomatology and to generate suggestions for future studies Methods: A systematic review of MedLine, EMBASE, PubMed and SPORTdiscus identifying prospective studies, that employed validated tools, measuring the effect of exercise interventions on fatigue and Quality of Life in survivors of childhood cancer, aged under eighteen at diagnosis. Result(s): Five hundred and fifty five papers were identified, two hundred and fourteen of which were screened following duplicate removal. Forty nine full text articles generated twelve studies of sufficient quality. Five randomised controlled trails were identified, the remainder were prospective observational studies. The largest had two hundred and twenty two participants, the smallest sixty eight. There were a total of six hundred and sixteen subjects and two hundred and sixty eight controls. Age range for intervention: 5-24 years. Statistically significant outcomes for fatigue and/or QoL and an overall positive outcome was seen in five studies. Statistically significant results but overall equivocal outcomes were seen in six studies. A negative outcome was seen in one study. No studies reported a cost/benefit analysis. Conclusion(s): Poor study design, a lack of standardised interventions and poor measurement of outcomes hampers research and the ability to give clear messages to childhood cancer survivors. A mixed methodology approach, employing recognised biomarkers, would define what interventions work well for children at different stages of development.

J2893,2021,Virtual patient assessment for hand fracture management: A departmental analysis of financial and clinical implications,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic demanded reduced face-to-face (FTF) contact. Our department integrated virtual assessment into the incoming referral pathway to enable continuation of high-quality care. This study aimed to assess any potential efficiency benefit of this change in service whilst ensuring no compromise to clinical outcomes. Method(s): A prospective analysis was undertaken of all hand fractures referred virtually during a seven-week period starting at the initiation of national lockdown. Cost analysis using NHS reference costs, inflated to 2019/20 prices, was performed. Clinical performance was assessed using the British Society for Surgery for the Hand (BSSH) Standards for Open and Closed Hand Fractures. Result(s): Seventy-six hand fractures were referred; FTF attendance was avoided in 35 cases, with an estimated per-patient cost saving of 179.16. Of the 33 patients who attended FTF, 13 achieved same day non-operative treatment; 20 underwent operative intervention with 95% compliance to BSSH standards. No complications occurred. Conclusion(s): Our pilot model demonstrates potentially significant cost savings of 6270 over a relatively short period, as well as clinical noninferiority. This supports sustained integration of virtual patient assessment in the 'new normal'. Further work across all disciplines is needed to define acceptable limits of telemedicine and new avenues for potential benefit.",TRUE,Mentions NHS and UK-specific standards,TRUE,Study involves NHS virtual assessment for hand fractures.,TRUE,Peer-reviewed article on virtual patient assessment.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative cost and clinical outcomes assessed with virtual vs FTF care.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['cost', 'clinical', 'utilization']",0.95,TRUE,"Virtual assessment replaces FTF, reducing admin burden.",Digital,Digital,0.9
J2894,2021,Effect of testing for cancer on cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â or venous thromboembolism (VTE)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated mortality and morbidity in people with unprovoked VTE,"- Background Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a collective term for two conditions: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). A proportion of people with VTE have no underlying or immediately predisposing risk factors and the VTE is referred to as unprovoked. Unprovoked VTE can often be the first clinical manifestation of an underlying malignancy. This has raised the question of whether people with an unprovoked VTE should be investigated for an underlying cancer. Treatment for VTE is different in cancer and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcancer patients and a correct diagnosis would ensure that people received the optimal treatment for VTE to prevent recurrence and further morbidity. Furthermore, an appropriate cancer diagnosis at an earlier stage could avoid the risk of cancer progression and lead to improvements in cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated mortality and morbidity. This is the third update of the review first published in 2015. Objectives To determine whether testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT of the lower limb or PE) is effective in reducing cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â or VTEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated mortality and morbidity and to determine which tests for cancer are best at identifying treatable cancers early. Search methods The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 5 May 2021. We also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies. Selection criteria Randomised and quasiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârandomised trials in which people with an unprovoked VTE were allocated to receive specific tests for identifying cancer or clinically indicated tests only were eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE criteria. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. The main outcomes of interest were allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcause mortality, cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated mortality and VTEÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated mortality. Main results No new studies were identified for this 2021 update. In total, four studies with 1644 participants are included. Two studies assessed the effect of extensive tests including computed tomography (CT) scanning versus tests at the physician's discretion, while the other two studies assessed the effect of standard testing plus positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanning versus standard testing alone. For extensive tests including CT versus tests at the physician's discretion, the certainty of the evidence, as assessed according to GRADE, was low due to risk of bias (early termination of the studies). When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT scanning versus standard testing alone, the certainty of evidence was moderate due to a risk of detection bias. The certainty of the evidence was downgraded further as detection bias was present in one study with a low number of events. When comparing extensive tests including CT versus tests at the physician's discretion, pooled analysis on two studies showed that testing for cancer was consistent with either benefit or no benefit on cancerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.67; 396 participants; 2 studies; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). One study (201 participants) showed that, overall, malignancies were less advanced at diagnosis in extensively tested participants than in participants in the control group. In total, 9/13 participants diagnosed with cancer in the extensively tested group had a T1 or T2 stage malignancy compared to 2/10 participants diagnosed with cancer in the control group (OR 5.00, 95% CI 1.05 to 23.76; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence).

J2895,2021,"How to save a small fortune! Improving the quality, clinical and cost effectiveness of oral nutritional supplement (ONS) prescribing in NHS Scotland","Introduction : In 2016 work began to accelerate transformational change for high quality, clinically and cost-effective patient care and oral nutritional supplement (ONS) prescribing in line with the Scottish Government's Quality Ambitions and Once for Scotland vision. Method(s): Sustained development has been enabled through an inter-professional Short Life Working Group (SLWG) and continued collaboration between the Scottish Dietetic Prescribing Support Group, Dietetic Leadership Network and Effective Prescribing & Therapeutics branch (Scottish Government). Result(s): All 14 NHS Boards in Scotland are progressing with implementing the SLWG's 12 key recommendations, published 2018. Key results: 1. Current data (2019) indicates improvement to the appropriateness of ONS prescribing; annual Scottish % variance ONS volume use (+3.8% 2015-16; -4% 2018-19) and cost (16 million 2015-16; 11 million 2018-19). 2. Standardised ONS prescribing data reporting and analysis is now used by all 14 NHS Boards in Scotland to continually drive improvement 3. Formulary variation is being reduced through Scotland wide Best Practice Guidance for Adult ONS Formulary Development 4. Continuous improvement to unwarranted variation in practice and processes has been driven through findings from structured interviews, e-surveys and a focus group.

J2899,2021,Primary prevention of variceal bleeding in people with oesophageal varices due to liver cirrhosis: a network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis,"- Background Approximately 40% to 95% of people with cirrhosis have oesophageal varices. About 15% to 20% of oesophageal varices bleed in about one to three years. There are several different treatments to prevent bleeding, including: betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers, endoscopic sclerotherapy, and variceal band ligation. However, there is uncertainty surrounding their individual and relative benefits and harms. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices in adults with liver cirrhosis through a network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis and to generate rankings of the different treatments for prevention of first variceal bleeding from oesophageal varices according to their safety and efficacy. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to December 2019 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding. Selection criteria We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history of bleeding. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previous bleeding from oesophageal varices and those who had previously undergone liver transplantation or previously received prophylactic treatment for oesophageal varices. Data collection and analysis We performed a network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the differences in treatments using hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and rate ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an availableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcase analysis, according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. We performed the direct comparisons from randomised clinical trials using the same codes and the same technical details. Main results We included 66 randomised clinical trials (6653 participants) in the review. Sixty trials (6212 participants) provided data for one or more comparisons in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies and those at high risk of bleeding from oesophageal varices. The followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup in the trials that reported outcomes ranged from 6 months to 60 months. All but one of the trials were at high risk of bias. The interventions compared included betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers, no active intervention, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus variceal band ligation, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus nitrates, nitrates, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus sclerotherapy, and portocaval shunt. Overall, 21.2% of participants who received nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âselective betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers ('betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers') ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ the reference treatment (chosen because this was the most common treatment compared in the trials) ÃƒÂ¢Ã‹â€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ died during 8ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmonth to 60ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmonth followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup. Based on lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus nitrates all had lower mortality versus no active intervention (betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers: HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.36 to 0.67; direct comparison HR: 0.59, 95% CrI 0.42 to 0.83; 10 trials, 1200 participants; variceal band ligation: HR 0.51, 95% CrI 0.35 to 0.74; direct comparison HR 0.49, 95% CrI 0.12 to 2.14; 3 trials, 355 participants; sclerotherapy: HR 0.66, 95% CrI 0.51 to 0.85; direct comparison HR 0.61, 95% CrI 0.41 to 0.90; 18 trials, 1666 participants; betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus nitrates: HR 0.41, 95% CrI 0.20 to 0.85; no direct comparison). No trials reported healthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated quality of life. Based on lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, variceal band ligation had a higher number of serious adverse events (number of events) than betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers (rate ratio 10.49, 95% CrI 2.83 to 60.64; 1 trial, 168 participants). Based on lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus nitrates had a higher number of 'any adverse events (number of participants)' than betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers alone (OR 3.4 , 95% CrI 1.11 to 11.28; 1 trial, 57 participants). Based on lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, adverse events (number of events) were higher in sclerotherapy than in betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers (rate ratio 2.49, 95% CrI 1.53 to 4.22; direct comparison rate ratio 2.47, 95% CrI 1.27 to 5.06; 2 trials, 90 participants), and in betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus variceal band ligation than in betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers (direct comparison rate ratio 1.72, 95% CrI 1.08 to 2.76; 1 trial, 140 participants). Based on lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, any variceal bleed was lower in betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus variceal band ligation than in betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers (direct comparison HR 0.21, 95% CrI 0.04 to 0.71; 1 trial, 173 participants). Based on lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, any variceal bleed was higher in nitrates than betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers (direct comparison HR 6.40, 95% CrI 1.58 to 47.42; 1 trial, 52 participants). The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons. Authors' conclusions Based on lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus nitrates may decrease mortality compared to no intervention in people with highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârisk oesophageal varices in people with cirrhosis and no previous history of bleeding. Based on lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious adverse events than betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers versus variceal band ligation on variceal bleeding. The evidence also indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in most of the remaining comparisons. Plain language summary Treatment to prevent first bleeding from dilated veins in the oesophagus resulting from advanced scarring of the liver What was the aim of this Cochrane Review? We aimed to find the best available treatment for prevention of first bleeding from oesophageal varices (enlarged veins in the food pipe (oesophagus)) in people with advanced liver scarring (liver cirrhosis, or late stage scarring of the liver with complications). People with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices are at significant risk of bleeding and death. Therefore, treatment is important, but the benefits and harms of different treatments available are currently unclear. The review authors collected and analysed 66 randomised clinical trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups) with the aim of finding what the best treatment is. During analysis of data, we used standard Cochrane methods, which allow the comparison of only two treatments at a time. We also used advanced techniques that allow comparison of multiple treatments at the same time (referred to as 'network (or indirect) metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis'). Date of literature search December 2019 Key messages We found that only one of the trials was conducted without flaws, and because of this, there is high to very high uncertainty in the findings. Approximately one in five trial participants with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices who never had bleeding previously and received the standard treatment of betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers died within five years of treatment. The funding source for the research was unclear in 50 trials; commercial organisations funded five trials. There were no concerns regarding the source of funding for the remaining 11 trials. What was studied in the review? This review looked at adults of any sex, age, and ethnic origin with advanced liver disease due to various causes and oesophageal varices, but never had bleeding from the oesophageal varices. Participants were given different treatments for prevention of first bleeding from oesophageal varices. The authors excluded studies in people who had previous bleeding from the oesophageal varices and those who had had a liver transplant or already received treatment for oesophageal varices previously. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 40 years to 63 years. The treatments included 'nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âselective betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers' or simply 'betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers' (drugs that slow the heart and decrease the force of heart pumping resulting in decrease pressure in the blood vessels; they also increase the pressure in the gut blood vessels decreasing the amount of blood reaching the oesophageal veins), endoscopic sclerotherapy (injecting clotting agents into the enlarged veins by looking through a tube inserted through the mouth), variceal band ligation (inserting elastic bands around the widened veins by using a tube inserted through the mouth), and nitrates (medicines that decrease the pressure in the gut blood vessels by widening them). The review authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death (percentage dead at maximal followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup), quality of life, serious and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âserious side effects, percentage of people who developed bleeding, and development of other complications of advanced liver disease.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ What were the main results of the review? The 66 studies included a relatively small number of participants (6653 people). Sixty studies with 6212 participants provided data for analyses. The followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup of the trial ranged from six months to five years in studies that reported the outcomes that we were interested in. The review found the following:ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Approximately one in five people with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices (without previous bleeding) who receive the betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers died within five years.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus nitrates all may result in fewer deaths than no treatment.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious side effects than betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Sclerotherapy, betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus nitrates, and betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus variceal band ligation may result in more side effects (when serious and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âserious adverse events were put together) than betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus variceal band ligation may result in fewer people who develop bleeding than betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers alone based on a single small trial.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Nitrates alone may result in more people who develop bleeding than betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers alone.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of the interventions in the remaining comparisons.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ None of the trials reported healthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated quality of life. What are our conclusions? BetaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers, variceal band ligation, sclerotherapy, and betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers plus nitrates may decrease the death rate compared to no treatment in people with highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârisk oesophageal varices in people with cirrhosis and no history of bleeding. Variceal band ligation may result in a higher number of serious side effects than betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers. The evidence indicates considerable uncertainty about the effect of betaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âblockers versus variceal band ligation on variceal bleeding.

J2906,2021,A review of emergency models of care for cancer patients,"Introduction Emergency departments (ED) are considered sub-optimal to satisfy the needs of cancer patients. Various international groups have developed strategies to improve the acute attention of cancer patients. This study aims to review the existing evidence on the effectivity of various innovative models of care for cancer emergency attention. Methods Literature review of seven databases during the period 2000-2019, including articles published in English and Spanish. Results A total of 10 articles were included: four descriptive studies, three quasi-experimental studies, two retrospective studies, and a qualitative study. They described new strategies in common ED clinical pathways or the creation of specialized units for the attention of cancer emergencies. The authors report reductions in the number of admissions, length of hospital stay and, furthermore, cost reductions. A previous triage and telephone attention service is considered key to increase the efficiency of the interventions. The authors reflect the importance of multidisciplinary attention, early integration of palliative care, and effective coordination with community services. Conclusions Enhancing the care of cancer patients who require emergency attention is possible through the creation of specific pathways or dedicated units staffed with professionals who are knowledgeable about cancer complications and treatment secondary effects. Specialized emergency cancer units seem to be a feasible and safe alternative to EDs, preventing overcrowding in the ED and avoiding unnecessary hospital admissions.",TRUE,"Unclear setting, flagged for review",TRUE,"Study involves emergency care models for cancer patients, likely in hospital settings.",TRUE,Peer-reviewed article reviewing emergency care models for cancer patients.,Peer-reviewed,0.9,TRUE,Comparative effects on cost and impact reported.,TRUE,Other,TRUE,"['clinical', 'cost', 'utilization']",0.9,TRUE,Specialized units and coordination with community services.,Community,Community; Prevention,0.9
J2907,2021,A Decision Analysis Evaluating Screening for Kidney Cancer Using Focused Renal Ultrasound,"Background: Screening for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been identified as a key research priority; however, no randomised control trials have been performed. Value of information analysis can determine whether further research on this topic is of value. Objective(s): To determine (1) whether current evidence suggests that screening is potentially cost-effective and, if so, (2) in which age/sex groups, (3) identify evidence gaps, and (4) estimate the value of further research to close those gaps. Design, setting, and participants: A decision model was developed evaluating screening in asymptomatic individuals in the UK. A National Health Service perspective was adopted. Intervention(s): A single focused renal ultrasound scan compared with standard of care (no screening). Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Expected lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results and limitations: Given a prevalence of RCC of 0.34% (0.18-0.54%), screening 60-yr-old men resulted in an ICER of 18 092/QALY (22 843/QALY). Given a prevalence of RCC of 0.16% (0.08-0.25%), screening 60-yr-old women resulted in an ICER of 37 327/QALY (47 129/QALY). In the one-way sensitivity analysis, the ICER was <30 000/QALY as long as the prevalence of RCC was >=0.25% for men and >=0.2% for women at age 60 yr. Given the willingness to pay a threshold of 30 000/QALY (37 878/QALY), the population-expected values of perfect information were 194 million (244 million) and 97 million (123 million) for 60-yr-old men and women, respectively. The expected value of perfect parameter information suggests that the prevalence of RCC and stage shift associated with screening are key research priorities. Conclusion(s): Current evidence suggests that one-off screening of 60-yr-old men is potentially cost-effective and that further research into this topic would be of value to society. Patient Summary: Economic modelling suggests that screening 60-yr-old men for kidney cancer using ultrasound may be a good use of resources and that further research on this topic should be performed.

J6205,2025,A Systematic Literature Review of Randomized Trials Comparing In-Person and Digital Interventions for Type 2 Diabetes Prevention,"Background: Digital and in-person lifestyle interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are being increasingly implemented in some countries, particularly in the United States. However, their comparative effectiveness remains unclear, partly due to variability in intervention designs and limited robust evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Understanding their relative impacts is critical for informing evidence-based implementation in diverse healthcare settings. Aim(s): To compare the effectiveness of digital versus in-person interventions for preventing T2DM. Method(s): We conducted a systematic literature review, following Cochrane methodology to identify and synthesize evidence from RCTs. Searches were conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to December 2024, including completed and ongoing trials published in English or Spanish. Studies comparing purely digital and in-person interventions were eligible. Meta-analyses were performed where appropriate, and narrative syntheses were provided for remaining outcomes. The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Result(s): Eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria, including six completed trials with published results and two ongoing trials. The completed trials encompassed a total of 2,450 participants across various healthcare settings. At 12 months, digital interventions were associated with significantly greater weight loss than in-person interventions (mean difference: -1.38 kg [95% CI: -2.34 to -0.43]), with moderate certainty of evidence. At shorter (3 and 6 months) and longer (>12 months) time points, no relevant differences were observed for weight, body mass index, or glycosylated haemoglobin levels between the modalities, with the certainty of evidence rated as low to very low. Evidence about cost-effectiveness was scarce. No trials evaluated key outcomes such as incidence of T2DM or health-related quality. For adverse events, no significant differences were found between modalities (RR: 1.06 [95% CI: 0.45 to 2.50]). Conclusion(s): This systematic review highlights that while digital and in-person interventions can both be effective for T2DM prevention, their relative benefits depend on follow-up duration and contextual factors. The limited certainty of evidence and the absence of trials addressing critical outcomes, such as T2DM incidence, underscore the need for further well-designed RCTs. Future research should prioritize equivalence in intervention intensity, longer follow-up durations, and standardized reporting of outcomes to better inform public health decision-making.

J6207,2025,Economic evaluation of a hospital-initiated tobacco dependence treatment service,"The treatment of tobacco dependence in patients admitted to hospital is a priority for the National Health Service in England. We conducted an economic analysis of a pilot intervention adapted from the Ottawa Model of Smoking Cessation, implemented in a major teaching hospital in London, England. The cost-per-patient, cost-per-quit and Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio were estimated for 673 patients who smoked and who received the intervention after being admitted to one of 11 acute wards between July 2020 and June 2021. Patient-level readmission costs and bed-days from six months after discharge were compared between the intervention group and a group of benchmark patients who smoked and who did not receive the intervention. The total cost of the intervention was 178,105. On the basis of 104 patients who reported not smoking at six months, the cost-per-quit was 1712.55. Among 611 patients who were successfully matched to a benchmark cohort, re-admissions for patients in the intervention group cost 492k less than their benchmark equivalents over 21 months from January 2021 to September 2022 (266k vs 758k), incurred 414 fewer bed days (303 vs 717), and re-admitted at a lower rate (5% vs 11%). Lower readmission rates and costs were associated with the intervention regardless of patient smoking status at six months, except among those who had opted out. A pilot tobacco dependence treatment intervention implemented in an acute hospital setting in London demonstrated value for money through reduced readmission rates and costs among all patients who received it.

J6209,2025,Tranexamic acid for preventing postpartum haemorrhage after vaginal birth,"- Rationale Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is common and potentially lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âthreatening. The antifibrinolytic drug tranexamic acid (TXA) is thought to be effective for treating PPH. There is growing interest in whether TXA is effective for preventing PPH after vaginal birth. In randomised controlled trials (RCTs), TXA has been associated with increased risk of seizures and unexplained increased mortality when given more than three hours after traumatic bleeding. Reliable evidence on the effects, costÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffectiveness and safety of prophylactic TXA is required before considering widespread use. This review updates one published in 2015. Objectives To assess the effects of TXA for preventing PPH compared to placebo or no treatment (with or without uterotonic coÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âtreatment) in women following vaginal birth. Search methods We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and WHO ICTRP (to 6 September 2024). We also searched reference lists of retrieved studies. Eligibility criteria We included RCTs evaluating TXA alone or in addition to standard care (uterotonics) for preventing PPH following vaginal birth. For this update, we required trials to be prospectively registered (before participant recruitment), and we applied a trustworthiness checklist. Outcomes Critical outcomes were blood loss ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 500 mL and blood loss ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 1000 mL. Important outcomes included maternal death, severe morbidity, blood transfusion, receipt of additional surgical interventions to control PPH, thromboembolic events, receipt of additional uterotonics, hysterectomy, and maternal satisfaction. Risk of bias We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 1) to assess the risk of bias in the studies. Synthesis methods Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and assessed trial trustworthiness. We used randomÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffects metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis to combine data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. Included studies We included three RCTs with 18,974 participants in total. The trials were conducted in both highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âresource settings and involved participants at both low and high risk of PPH. The trials compared intravenous TXA (1 g) and standard care versus placebo (saline) and standard care. After applying our trustworthiness checklist, we did not include any of the 12 trials in the previous version of this review. Synthesis of results Prophylactic tranexamic acid in addition to standard care compared to placebo in addition to standard care TXA results in little to no difference in blood loss ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 500 mL (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; 2 studies, 18,897 participants; 5 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 15 fewer to 5 more; highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). TXA likely results in little to no difference in blood loss ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 1000 mL (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.07; 2 studies, 18,897 participants; 3 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 1 more; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). TXA likely results in little to no difference in severe morbidity (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.12; 1 study, 15,066 participants; 2 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 6 fewer to 2 more; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). TXA results in little to no difference in receipt of blood transfusion (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; 3 studies, 18,972 participants; 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 10 fewer to 12 more; highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). TXA may result in little to no difference in receipt of additional surgical interventions to control PPH (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.23; 2 studies, 18,972 participants; 1 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 2 fewer to 1 more; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). In women with anaemia, TXA results in little to no difference in receipt of additional uterotonics (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.10; 1 study, 15,066 participants; 3 more women per 1000, 95% CI 8 fewer to 24 more; highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). In women with no anaemia, TXA results in a slight reduction in receipt of additional uterotonics (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.92; 1 study, 3891 participants; 24 fewer women per 1000, 95% CI 38 fewer to 8 fewer; highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). TXA likely r sults in little to no difference in maternal satisfaction. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of TXA on maternal death, thromboembolic events, and hysterectomy (very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence): maternal death (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.49; 2 studies, 15,081 participants; 0 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 1 fewer to 2 more); thromboembolic events (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.24; 3 studies, 18,774 participants; 3 fewer women per 10,000, 95% CI 4 fewer to 5 more); hysterectomy (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.19; 1 study, 15,066 participants; 1 fewer women per 10,000, 95% CI 9 fewer to 16 more). Authors' conclusions Adding prophylactic TXA to standard care of women during vaginal birth makes little to no difference to blood loss ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 500 mL and likely makes little to no difference to blood loss ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 1000 mL or the risk of severe morbidity, compared to placebo and standard care. TXA may result in little to no difference in additional surgical interventions to control PPH and results in little to no difference in blood transfusions. One trial found that TXA reduced the use of additional uterotonics in women without anaemia, whereas the largest trial found little to no difference in the use of additional uterotonics in women with anaemia. Although there were very few serious adverse events reported, the evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions about the effect of TXA on maternal death, thromboembolic events, hysterectomy, or seizures. TXA likely results in little to no difference in maternal satisfaction. These findings are based mainly on two large trials. In the smaller of these, less than 30% of study participants were at high risk of PPH. In the largest trial, all participants had moderate to severe anaemia. Those making decisions about routine administration of prophylactic TXA for all women having vaginal births should consider that current evidence does not show a benefit of TXA for blood loss outcomes and related morbidity, and the evidence is very uncertain about serious adverse events.

Key messages Tranexamic acid given as a preventive treatment makes little to no difference to heavy bleeding after vaginal birth. We are uncertain about whether there are any harmful effects from tranexamic acid. What is the issue? Postpartum haemorrhage, which is heavy bleeding after giving birth, is a common and potentially lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âthreatening complication of birthing a child. Most women receive drugs (called uterotonics) that stimulate the womb to contract after a normal (vaginal) delivery to prevent postpartum haemorrhage. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a medication that is used to decrease blood loss in surgery and health conditions associated with increased bleeding. It works by helping to prevent the breakdown of blood clots. If a woman is bleeding heavily after birth, it decreases blood loss. We do not know if TXA can help prevent heavy bleeding after vaginal birth. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know whether fewer women have heavy bleeding after a vaginal birth if they receive TXA, with or without additional uterotonics, during vaginal birth. We also wanted to find out if taking TXA during vaginal birth was associated with any harmful effects. What did we do? We searched for and selected all the studies that addressed our question. We used a checklist to make sure we only included studies with information we could verify. We made judgements about the quality of the studies before comparing and summarising the results of the studies. Lastly, we rated our confidence in the findings. Why is this important? It is important to determine whether TXA is effective in preventing heavy bleeding after birth when given to women during vaginal birth. If there is a benefit, it could help women around the world and even play a role in reducing the number of women who die after giving birth. How up to date is this evidence? We searched for all available evidence up to 6 September 2024. What evidence did we find? We identified three studies that investigated the effects of preventive TXA. The three studies involved a total of 18,974 participants at low or high risk of heavy bleeding. Participants were given either intravenous (into a vein) TXA plus standard care or placebo (saline) injection plus standard care. We found that preventive TXA results in little to no difference in heavy bleeding after birth. We are very uncertain about the effect of TXA on maternal death. TXA likely makes no difference to the risk of women developing serious illness. We found that TXA has no effect on the likelihood of receiving a blood transfusion. TXA may result in no difference in the need for further surgical intervention after giving birth. We are very uncertain about the effect of TXA on blood clots. In women with anaemia, TXA makes no difference to the need for additional drugs to help the womb contract, but in women with no anaemia, there was a slight reduction in this outcome. We are very uncertain about the effect of TXA on hysterectomy (an operation to remove the womb). There does not seem to be a difference in maternal satisfaction. What are the limitations of the evidence? The studies included women in both highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âresource settings. Few women experienced harmful effects. However, we cannot be certain that this is indeed the case in the real world. What does this mean? We found no difference in the number of women experiencing heavy bleeding after birth after they were given TXA preventatively during vaginal birth, and we are very uncertain about the effect of TXA on blood clots and other serious side effects. As these are harmful effects, clinicians should take into account the lack of benefit and the potential harms when considering giving routine TXA to women during vaginal birth.

J6212,2025,"Cost-effectiveness of BOOST online intervention for supported self-management of pain, fatigue and bowel incontinence in Inflammatory Bowel Disease","Background: People with IBD often experience symptoms of abdominal pain, fatigue and bowel incontinence that affect substantially their daily lives1 . IBD-BOOST is the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing the effectiveness of an online self-management intervention, BOOST, in managing these symptoms in IBD2 . We report the cost-effectiveness of BOOST intervention compared to care as usual for people with IBD. Method(s): A cost-utility analysis was conducted alongside the pragmatic IBD-BOOST RCT of 780 patients requesting help for pain, fatigue or incontinence symptoms (mean age 49 years, 67% women, 55% with Crohn's disease)3 . The BOOST intervention costs and costs from patient-reported health service use, out-of-pocket expenses and time off work were calculated for each participant over the 12 months of follow-up. Qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs) over the 12 months were evaluated using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaires administered to participants at baseline, 6- and 12-months. Missing data (13% at 6 months and 38% at 12 months across the trial arms) was imputed using multiple imputation. Differences in total costs and QALYs between study arms were estimated using mixed effects models adjusting for pre-specified baseline factors. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net monetary benefit from UK healthcare and societal perspectives are reported. Result(s): At recruitment, study participants reported quality of life (EQ-5D utility) of 0.73 (SD 0.22) and overall IBD-related costs of 2321 (SD 3170) over the previous 3 months with cost of biologics accounting for 47% of these costs, followed by hospital outpatient services (22%) and work productivity loss costs (14%) (Figure 1). After missing data imputation and controlling for covariates, the BOOST intervention (151 per participant) was estimated to have led to health care cost savings of 746 (SE 356), other costs savings of 89 (SE 236) and incremental QALYs of 0.017 (SE 0.007) over the one-year follow-up per participant resulting in cost savings per QALY gained of 34,599 from the health services perspective and 39,745 from the societal perspective. The probability that the BOOST intervention was cost effective when compared with usual care was above 98% for willingness-to-pay thresholds of 20,000 to 30,000 from both health services and societal perspectives (Figure 2). Conclusion(s): Our findings indicate that the BOOST intervention for supported self-management of symptoms of pain, fatigue and bowel incontinence in people with IBD is cost-effective.

J6213,2025,Can home-exercise programmes delivered via a handout format result in sufficient adherence among patients with musculoskeletal conditions/injuries? A systematic review,"Purpose: Musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions and injuries are a leading cause of disability globally, with the prevalence continuing to rise due to an increasing ageing population. This consequently increases the demands placed on health services to manage widespread physical disability to support those affected. In the UK, the NHS spends approximately 5bn a year treating MSK conditions, accounting for one of the largest areas of NHS expenditure and the biggest areas of workload. Home exercise programmes (HEPs) are a key component of evidence-based management of MSK conditions. However, effectiveness of treatment relies on patient adherence to these exercise programmes with the wider literature suggesting non-adherence rates may be as high as 70%. Adherence to physiotherapy interventions proves to be a complex issue and the reasons for poor adherence are shown to be multi-faceted. An avenue of exploration is the method of HEP delivery, which traditionally has been by verbal instruction often with a paper handout, although the use of digitised methods (e.g. smartphone Apps) are becoming more popular. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to understand if sufficient HEP adherence can be achieved when delivered via a printed format compared to alternate methods or physiotherapy interventions, specifically among adults treated for a MSK condition/injury. Method(s): This systematic review conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Six databases were searched from inception to April 2024: CINAHL, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO and PubMed. Randomised clinical trials comparing HEPs delivered via paper handout versus alternate delivery methods or physiotherapy interventions, and the effect on adherence rates, were included. Methodological quality and certainty of evidence were assessed by one reviewer using the Cochrane RoB2 tool and modified GRADE approach, respectively. Result(s): Fifteen studies were included for review, categorised based on the type of intervention compared to paper handout, e.g., smart-device Apps/other digitised methods, supervised exercise, SMS/phone reminders. The findings suggest that while the use of paper handouts is superior to verbal instruction alone, Apps with more extensive functionalities, such as, remote monitoring, self-recording abilities and reminder notifications may promote even greater HEP adherence rates. However, studies were either of 'some concern' or 'high' risk of bias, and the overall quality (certainty) of evidence was determined to be 'low', meaning the ability to draw firm conclusions and recommendations is limited. Conclusion(s): Apps may potentially facilitate better adherence rates, but further high-quality research is required to firmly recommend a HEP delivery method. Clinicians should tailor their approaches specific to patients' needs and profiles, gaining an understanding of their patients' previous experiences, expectations and self-efficacy. Impact: The project highlights the need for more high-quality research in this important area of exercise therapy adherence. Methods of improving the currently poor adherence rates need to be established. Cost-effectiveness of such methods should also be researched prior to any widespread implementation. Facilitating better patient adherence with home-exercise treatment can lead to improved patient outcomes and self-management, which in turn can reduce healthcare provider burden and expenditure.

J6218,2025,Direct factor Xa inhibitors versus low molecular weight heparins or vitamin K antagonists for prevention of venous thromboembolism in elective primary hip or knee replacement or hip fracture repair,"- Background People undergoing major orthopaedic surgery are at increased risk of postoperative thromboembolic events. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are recommended for thromboprophylaxis in this population. New oral anticoagulants, including direct factor Xa inhibitors, are recommended as alternatives. They may have more advantages than disadvantages compared to LMWHs and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs, another type of anticoagulant). Objectives To assess the benefits and harms of prophylactic anticoagulation with direct factor Xa inhibitors compared with low molecular weight heparins and vitamin K antagonists in people undergoing major orthopaedic surgery for elective total hip or knee replacement or hip fracture surgery. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, two other databases, and two trial registers to 11 November 2023. We conducted reference checks to identify additional studies. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of direct factor Xa inhibitors to LMWHs or VKAs in people undergoing major orthopaedic surgery. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcause mortality, major venous thromboembolism (VTE), symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and serious hepatic and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhepatic adverse events. We evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies using Cochrane's risk of bias 1 tool. We calculated estimates of treatment effects using risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included 53 RCTs (44,371 participants). Participants' average age was 64 years (range: 18 to 93 years). Only one RCT compared a VKA with direct factor Xa inhibitors. All 53 RCTs compared direct factor Xa inhibitors with LMWHs. TwentyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âthree studies included participants undergoing total hip replacement; 21 studies, total knee replacement; and three studies included people having hip fracture surgery. The studies' average duration was approximately 42 days (range: two to 720 days). Compared to LMWHs, direct factor Xa inhibitors may have little to no effect on allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcause mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.31; I 2 = 0%; 28 studies, 29,698 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Direct factor Xa inhibitors may make little to no difference to major venous thromboembolic events compared to LMWHs, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.71; absolute risk difference: 12 fewer major VTE events per 1000 participants, 95% CI 16 fewer to 7 fewer; I 2 = 48%; 28 studies, 24,574 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Compared to LMWHs, direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce symptomatic VTE (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.83; I 2 = 0%; 33 studies, 31,670 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). The absolute benefit of substituting factor Xa inhibitors for LMWHs may be between two and five fewer symptomatic VTE episodes per 1000 patients. In the metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis with all studies pooled, direct factor Xa inhibitors appeared to make little or no difference to major bleeding compared to LMWHs, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.30; I 2 = 15%; 36 studies, 39,778 participants; very low certaintyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âevidence). ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ In a subgroup analysis limited to studies comparing rivaroxaban to LMWHs, people given rivaroxaban may have had more major bleeding events (RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.98; I 2 = 0%; 17 studies, 17,630 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). The absolute risk of substituting rivaroxaban for LMWH may be between one and seven more major bleeding events per 1000 patients. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ In a subgroup analysis limited to studies comparing direct factor Xa inhibitors other than rivaroxaban to LMWHs, people given these other direct factor Xa inhibitors may have had fewer major bleeding events, but the evidence was very uncertain (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.02; absolute risk difference: 3 fewer major bl eding events per 1000 participants, 95% CI 5 fewer to 0 fewer; I 2 = 0%; 19 studies, 22,148 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Direct factor Xa inhibitors may make little to no difference in serious hepatic adverse events compared to LMWHs, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 3.01, 95% CI 0.12 to 73.93; 2 studies, 3169 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Only two studies reported this outcome, with one death in the intervention group due to hepatitis reported in one study, and no events reported in the other study. People given direct factor Xa inhibitors may have a lower risk of serious nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhepatic adverse events than those given LMWHs (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; I 2 = 18%; 15 studies, 26,246 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). The absolute benefit of substituting factor Xa inhibitors for LMWH may be between three and 14 fewer serious nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhepatic adverse events per 1000 patients. Only one study compared a direct factor Xa inhibitor with a VKA. It reported outcome data with imprecise results due to the small number of events. It showed no difference in the effects of the study drugs. Authors' conclusions Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may have little to no effect on allÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcause mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain. Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may slightly reduce symptomatic VTE events when compared with LMWH. They may make little or no difference to major VTE events, but the evidence is very uncertain. In the evaluation of major bleeding, the evidence suggests rivaroxaban results in a slight increase in major bleeding events compared to LMWHs. The remaining oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may have little to no effect on major bleeding, but the evidence is very uncertain. Oral direct factor Xa inhibitors may reduce serious nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhepatic adverse events slightly compared to LMWHs. They may have little to no effect on serious hepatic adverse events, but the evidence is very uncertain. Due to the high rates of missing participants and selective outcome reporting, the effect estimates may be biased. Plain language summary Direct factor Xa inhibitors or classic 'blood thinners': which leads to better outcomes for people undergoing major hip or knee surgery? Key messages ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ We do not know if classic anticoagulant medicines (commonly known as 'blood thinners') or newer bloodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âthinning medicines called 'direct factor Xa inhibitors' (DFXa inhibitors) are better at preventing death or the development of blood clots in the deep veins of the legs or in the lungs of people who have had hip or knee replacement surgery. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Compared to classic anticoagulants, DFXa inhibitors may slightly reduce the number of people who experience blood clot symptoms (such as breathing difficulties or pain). One type of DFXa inhibitor, rivaroxaban, may slightly increase the number of people who have serious uncontrolled bleeding. Why are blood clots a concern for people having major hip or knee surgery? 'Venous thromboembolism' is when a blood clot forms in a vein, the vessels that carry blood back to the heart. Clots can narrow or block veins, leading to tissue damage, stroke, and death. People having hip or knee replacement surgery, or an operation to fix a broken hip, are at a higher risk of developing a blood clot. How can blood clots be prevented and treated? People undergoing major hip or knee surgery are typically given an anticoagulant medicine, commonly known as a 'blood thinner', to help prevent blood clots from forming. There are two main types of 'classic' anticoagulants: (1) low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), which are injected with a needle at a fixed dose; and (2) vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), given by mouth in variable amounts. Newer anticoagulant medicines known as direct factor Xa inhibitors have been developed. They are given by mouth in fixed doses. Rivaroxaban and apixaban are types of DFXa inhibitors. What did we want to find out? We wanted to find out if DFXa inhibitors were better than classic anticoagulants at reducing the number of people who (1) died from any cause aft r major hip or knee surgery, and (2) developed blood clots or symptoms of blood clots (e.g. breathing difficulties and pain). We also wanted to find out if DFXa inhibitors were associated with any unwanted effects, including uncontrolled bleeding, serious liver disease, and other serious unwanted events. What did we do? We searched for studies that compared DFXa inhibitors with classic anticoagulants in people undergoing hip or knee surgery. We compared and summarised the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find? We found 53 studies that involved 44,371 adults who had hip or knee replacement surgery, and had a high risk of developing blood clots in their lungs, legs, or pelvis. They received anticoagulant treatment for 6 to 39 days, and followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup lasted for an average of 42 days. All 53 studies compared DFXa inhibitors with low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). Just one study also investigated the VKA called warfarin. The biggest study involved 5407 participants, and the smallest study, 50 participants. They were conducted in countries unevenly distributed around the world; most were done in highÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âincome regions. Roughly oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âthird of participants (31%) were male. Participants' average age was 64 years. Pharmaceutical companies funded half of the studies (27 of 53). Main results Compared to LMWHs, we do not know if DFXa inhibitors reduce the number of people who:ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ die from any cause after surgery, orÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ develop blood clots in the lungs or deep veins of the leg or pelvisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨because the evidence is very uncertain. Compared to LMWHs, DFXa inhibitors may slightly reduce the number of people who have blood clot symptoms: between 2 and 5 fewer people out of every 1000 people given DFXa inhibitors would have blood clot symptoms compared to people given LMWHs. The DFXa inhibitor rivaroxaban may slightly increase the number of people who have major uncontrolled bleeding compared to LMWHs. Between 1 and 7 more people out of every 1000 people given rivaroxaban may have uncontrolled bleeding compared to those given LMWHs. The other DFXa inhibitors may have little to no effect on major bleeding, but the evidence is very uncertain. Compared to LMWHs, DFXa inhibitors may have little to no effect on serious unwanted events affecting the liver, but the evidence is very uncertain. They may slightly reduce other serious, nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂliverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated events compared to LMWHs. Between 3 and 14 fewer people out of every 1000 people given DFXa inhibitors would have serious, nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂliverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated events compared to people given LMWHs. We did not find enough studies investigating VKAs to help us answer our questions. What are the limitations of the evidence? We have little confidence in the evidence because people in some studies were aware of which treatment they were getting. Most studies did not have a complete set of results for all participants. There were insufficient studies to be certain about the results of some outcomes. How current is this evidence?

J6223,2025,Rapid tests to inform triage and antibiotic prescribing decisions for adults presenting with suspected acute respiratory infection: a rapid evidence synthesis of clinical effectiveness and cost-utility studies,"<b>Background</b>: This review assessed the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of point-of-care tests to guide the initial management of people presenting with suspected acute respiratory infection.
<b>Methods</b>: Searches for systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials and cost-utility studies were conducted in May 2023. Sources included MEDLINE, Epistemonikos, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cost-effectiveness Analysis Registry and reference checking. Eligible studies included people (>= 16 years) making initial contact with the health system with symptoms suggestive of acute respiratory infection. Risk of bias in randomised controlled trials was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. The Drummond checklist was used for cost-utility studies. Meta-analyses of clinical outcomes were conducted to estimate summary risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Study characteristics and main results were summarised narratively and tabulated.
<b>Results</b>: Fourteen randomised controlled trials were included; all had a high risk of bias. Ten randomised controlled trials analysed point-of-care tests for C-reactive protein. Compared with usual care, the effects on hospital admissions and mortality were highly uncertain due to sparse data. Three randomised controlled trials had heterogeneous findings on the resolution of symptoms/time to full recovery. The risk of re-consultations increased in patients receiving C-reactive protein point-of-care tests (pooled risk ratio 1.61, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.41; four studies). There was a reduction in antibiotics initially prescribed (C-reactive protein point-of-care tests vs. usual care: pooled risk ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 0.84; nine studies). The effects of procalcitonin point-of-care tests compared with usual care on hospital admission, escalation of care, and duration of symptoms were very uncertain as only one randomised controlled trial was included. The study found a large reduction in antibiotic prescriptions within 7 days. Two studies revealed a large reduction in initial antibiotic prescriptions for Group A streptococcus point-of-care tests versus usual care. Only one study compared an influenza point-of-care test with usual care. The effect of the antibiotics prescribed was very uncertain. No deaths occurred in either treatment group.
<b>Cost-effectiveness</b>: Six of the 17 included cost-utility studies were judged to be directly applicable to our review, 4 of which focused on the C-reactive protein point-of-care test. The results suggested that the C-reactive protein point-of-care test is potentially cost-effective; these studies were generally limited to capturing only short-term costs and consequences. One study evaluated 14 different point-of-care tests for Group A streptococcus; none were cost-effective compared with usual care. A further study evaluated two rapid tests (Quidel for influenza [Quidel Corp, San Diego, CA, USA], and BinaxNOW [Binax, Inc., Portland, ME, USA]) for the pneumococcal antigen) compared to culture/serology and found that they were not cost-effective.
<b>Limitations</b>: Rapid synthesis methods were used, so relevant studies may have been missed. No evidence was identified for several review questions.
<b>Conclusion</b>: C-reactive protein point-of-care test may reduce the number of patients given an antibiotic prescription but could increase the rate of re-consultations. C-reactive protein point-of-care test may potentially be cost-effective but existing estimates were based on very small and uncertain gains in quality-adjusted life-years and only accounted for short-term costs and consequences. There was very limited or an absence of evidence for other point-of-care tests.
<b>Future work</b>: Research is needed to explore the impact of point-of-care tests on triaging decisions across different clinical settings and to quantify the longer-term health and cost consequences.

J6224,2025,Randomised controlled trial testing clinical and cost-effectiveness of the Live Well self-management toolkit for people with Parkinson's and their carers,"Background: Self-management interventions provide information and tools to people with long-term conditions to help them manage their own condition. They have been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare utilisation. Whilst charities and healthcare providers offer information and advice, there is no effective comprehensive self-management intervention available for people in the UK living with Parkinson's. Through co-design with people with Parkinson's, carers and healthcare professionals, systematic reviews, and qualitative studies, we developed the self-management Live Well with Parkinson's toolkit, facilitated by trained supporters. The toolkit contains information about symptoms, therapies, ways to optimise wellbeing, and practical advice. There are personalised sections covering information about themselves, their health and support, a calendar, to do lists, the ability to review and track symptoms, and an asset-based wellbeing section to identify health priorities they wanted to maintain. Method(s): This toolkit was tested in a single-blind randomised controlled trial in England. Participants were community-dwelling individuals, with a diagnosis of Parkinson's and randomised 1:1 to receive the Live Well with Parkinson's toolkit or treatment as usual. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (PDQ-39) at 12 months with a range of secondary outcome measures. Outcomes are being analysed using linear mixed models, controlling for baseline scores. Result(s): We recruited 346 participants between January 2022-July 2023 with a median age 71 years (IQR 11.25),159 (46%) women, and 297 (86%) White British. Data collection was completed in August 2024 with a retention rate of 88% at 12-month follow-up. The process evaluation revealed highly positive feedback. Clinical and cost-effectiveness analysis will be available for presentation at the conference, including primary and secondary outcomes. Conclusion(s): The outcomes of this programme will inform the effectiveness of this intervention, as well as the effective components, mechanisms, and future developments to improve quality of life for people with Parkinson's when using self-management tools.

J6228,2025,"Implementation strategies for WHO guidelines to prevent, detect, and treat postpartum hemorrhage","- Rationale Despite World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for preventing, detecting, and treating postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), effective implementation has lagged. Objectives To evaluate the clinical benefits and harms of implementation strategies used to promote adherence to WHO clinical guidelines for the prevention, detection, and treatment of PPH. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and two trial registries, along with reference checking, citation searching, and contact with study authors. The latest search date was 25 April 2024. Eligibility criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster, pragmatic, and steppedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âwedge designs, and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârandomized studies of interventions (NRSIs), including interrupted time series (ITS) studies, controlled beforeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âafter (CBA) studies, and followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup (cohort) studies containing concurrent controls that focused on or described implementation strategies of WHO guidelines for the prevention, detection, and treatment of PPH. Participants were birth attendants and people giving birth in a hospital or healthcare facility. We excluded studies that did not implement a WHO PPH recommendation, had no comparator group, or did not report clinical/implementation outcomes. Outcomes Our critical outcomes were: adherence to WHOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârecommended guidelines for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment; PPH ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 500 mL; PPH ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 1000 mL; additional uterotonics within 24 hours after birth; blood transfusions; maternal death; severe morbidities (major surgery; admission to intensive care unit [ICU]); and adverse effects (variable and related to the clinical intervention) during hospitalization for birth. Our important outcomes were: breastfeeding at discharge; implementation outcomes such as acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity, implementation cost, penetration, and sustainability of the implementation strategy; and health professional outcomes such as knowledge and skill. Risk of bias We used the RoB 2 and ROBINSÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂI tools to assess risk of bias in RCTs and NRSIs, respectively. Synthesis methods Two review authors independently selected studies, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias and trustworthiness. Due to the nature of the data, we reported relevant results for each comparison and outcome but did not attempt quantitative synthesis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence. Included studies We included 13 studies (9 clusterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂRCTs and 4 NRSIs) with a total of 1,027,273 births and more than 4373 birth attendants. The included studies were conducted in 17 different countries. Most trials were conducted in resourceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âlimited settings. None of the included studies reported data on the use of additional uterotonics within 24 hours after birth or adverse effects. Synthesis of results SingleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent implementation strategies versus usual care for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment We do not know if singleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent implementation strategies have any effect on adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations, PPH ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 500 mL, PPH ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 1000 mL, or blood transfusion (very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). LowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence suggests that singleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent implementation strategies may have little to no effect on maternal death (86,788 births, 3 trials); may increase severe morbidity related to ICU admission (26,985 births, 1 trial); and may reduce severe morbidity related to surgical outcomes (26,985 births, 1 trial). No trials in this comparison measured the effect on adherence to WHO treatment guidelines. Multicomponent implementation strategies versus usual care for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment We do not know if multicomponent implementation strategies have any effect on adherence to WHO PPH treatment recommendations, PPH ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 500 mL, blood transfusion, or severe morbidity relating to surgical outcomes (very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Multicomponent implementation strategies may have little to no effect on matern l death (274,008 births, 2 trials; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence) compared to usual care. No trials in this comparison measured the effect on adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations, PPH ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 1000 mL, or severe morbidity (outcomes related to ICU admission). Multicomponent implementation strategies versus enhanced usual care for PPH prevention, detection, and treatment LowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence suggests that multicomponent implementation strategies may improve adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations (14,718 births, 2 trials) and adherence to WHO PPH treatment recommendations (356,913 births, 2 trials) compared to enhanced usual care. Multicomponent implementation strategies probably have little to no effect on maternal death (224,850 births, 2 trials; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence), severe morbidity related to ICU admission (224,850 births, 2 trials; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence), and surgical morbidity (210,132 births, 1 trial; moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence) compared to enhanced usual care. We do not know if multicomponent implementation strategies affect PPH ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 500 mL, PPH ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 1000 mL, or blood transfusion (very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Multicomponent implementation strategies may improve adherence to WHO PPH prevention and treatment recommendations, but they probably result in little to no difference in ICU admissions, surgical morbidity, or maternal death. The majority of available evidence is of low to very low certainty, thus we cannot draw any robust conclusions on the effects of implementation strategies for WHO guidelines to prevent, detect, and treat PPH. While all included studies used the implementation strategy of 'train and educate,' the effects seem to be limited when used as a single strategy. Additional research using pragmatic, hybrid effectivenessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âimplementation study designs that measure implementation outcomes simultaneously alongside clinical outcomes would be beneficial to understand contextual factors, barriers, and facilitators that affect implementation.

Registration Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42024563802) available via https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42024563802 Plain language summary What are the best strategies to implement World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations to prevent, detect, and treat postpartum hemorrhage? Key messages Multicomponent implementation strategies may improve adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) prevention recommendations and probably do not make a difference to intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, need for additional surgeries, or death of the mother. We do not know if multicomponent implementation strategies affect blood loss or blood transfusion. We do not know if singleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent implementation strategies affect adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations, blood loss, or blood transfusion. SingleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent implementation strategies may not make a difference to the death of the mother, may increase ICU admissions, and may reduce the need for additional surgeries. The small number of studies and differences in data collected across included studies limited our ability to draw any conclusions on effective implementation strategies; however, there were varying degrees of success with identical implementation strategies in different studies, highlighting the need for future research in this area. What is postpartum hemorrhage (PPH)? Postpartum hemorrhage is typically defined as blood loss greater than 500 mL within 24 hours after birth. How is PPH prevented, diagnosed, and reated? WHO guidelines recommend oxytocin administration immediately after birth to prevent PPH. Some birth facilities use blood collection drapes and scales to measure blood loss; however, many do not have access to these supplies. The treatment of PPH varies based on the severity, underlying cause, and available resources. Most cases of PPH are treated with medications that cause the uterus to contract. In women who do not respond to this medication, uterine balloon tamponade (where a balloon is inflated in the uterus to compress blood vessels and stop bleeding) or surgery is needed. What are implementation strategies? Implementation strategies are specific techniques used to increase the acceptance, uptake, and sustainability of a clinical practice or program. Examples include engaging individuals and leaders, changing infrastructure, and training and educating and/or supporting birth attendants. How are implementation strategies used to prevent, diagnose, and treat PPH? A wide range of implementation strategies have been used in clinical practice to prevent, diagnose, and treat PPH. Strategies include training and educating skilled birth attendants in evidenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased practices, introducing new equipment to birth facilities, and developing reporting systems to audit health records and provide feedback to healthcare workers. What did we want to find out? We wanted to know which, if any, implementation strategies of WHO PPH recommendations are effective in facilityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âbased childbirth settings. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at the effects of implementation strategies of WHO PPH recommendations by birth attendants on people who gave birth in a health facility. We summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence based on factors such as study methods and sizes. What did we find out? We included 13 studies, which were categorized into three groups based on the implementation strategies used: (1) single strategy versus usual care, (2) multiple strategies versus usual care, and (3) multiple strategies versus enhanced usual care. We do not know if singleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent implementation strategies affect adherence to WHO PPH prevention recommendations, blood loss, or blood transfusion. SingleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent implementation strategies may not make a difference to maternal death, may reduce the need for additional surgeries, but may also increase ICU admissions. Multicomponent implementation strategies may improve adherence to PPH prevention recommendations and probably do not make a difference to ICU admissions, need for additional surgeries, or maternal death. We do not know if multicomponent implementation strategies affect blood loss or blood transfusion. We found that the same implementation strategies and study approach can increase adherence to WHO guidelines in one setting, not make any difference in another, and even reduce adherence in others. Many studies lacked a comprehensive framework that linked implementation efforts with adherence to WHO recommendations and patient outcomes; it is doubtful that multicomponent intervention could address all factors that contribute to PPHÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated illness or death. It remains unknown whether multiple strategies work in a realÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âworld setting. What are the limitations of the evidence? The level of detail of implementation strategies varied, preventing the combining of studies. There were also differences in the people included in the studies according to facility level, volume of births, and type of delivery. Different study contexts made it difficult to measure the true impact of implementation strategies on outcomes. How upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdate is this evidence?

J6242,2025,Cost-effective and Green renal failure care - Hope or Reality : A proof of concept study,"Introduction: End-Stage Kidney disease (ESKD) has multi systems impact on patients and they require many interventions to manage their clinical state and maintain a reasonable quality of life. They warrant regular investigations to manage anaemia, metabolic state, fluid status and preserving a functioning dialysis access till they have renal transplantation. These interventions are intrusive, invasive and require repeated visits to their hospital and other clinical sites where the service provided. Remote measurement of the parameters will reduce the burden to patients and also the travel involved can reduce the impact of carbon emission to the local communities. The Alio SmartPatchTM represents a breakthrough in anaemia management in Chronic Kidney disease and it's a FDA- cleared device, the SmartPatch offers improvement over existing technologies by enabling real- time, non-invasive, and remote monitoring of multiple health parameters such as Heart rate, SaO2, Haemoglobin, Haematocrit, fluid status and the world's first non-invasive monitoring of abnormal potassium via a functioning AV access. In this study, we aims to evaluate the distance travelled between various sites needed to have their care for ESKD and assess the impact of using alio smartpatch and point of care ultrasound in reducing the travel need, thereby the impact on carbon emission. Method(s): The data was obtained from a prospective, open-labeled, non-randomized study performed to compare Haemoglobin, Haematocrit and Potassium results from the SmartPatch with the laboratory results during the same haemodialysis session. Adults with capacity to consent and receiving haemodialysis via an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG) in either upper limb were enrolled in this study. The SmartPatch was placed over the AV access site prior to the pre-dialysis blood draw. Skin color was classified using the Massey scale: light tones (1) to very dark tones (10). For this analysis, the pigmentation scale was divided into three categories: light (types 1-2), medium (types 3-5), and dark (types 5). The study was performed in United Kingdom, United States and Jordan. The distance travelled by the patient who participated in this study in single centre was measured and carbon emission calculation was performed using Greenhouse Gases Equivalencies Calculator. Result(s): A total of 21 patients from single UK site were selected for this analysis. There was consistent cost-savings was found in all study patients whom did self-care in the dialysis centre or required nursing or medical input to offer them appropriate care. The average travel distance for dialysis - 14.5 miles (three times a week) and we included for three unexpected visits / year. The calculation for annual Carbon footprint / Patient (Metric tons (MT) CO2) for Blood & Access latency visits is 0.08 and when combined with haemodialysis, it;s 0.62. For the study cohort, the blood & access review amounts to 1.68 MT and with HD, 13.02. The study centre dialyses 1100 patients and integrating remote monitoring device such as alio smartpatch will lead to 88MT and with HD -682 MT and to demonstrate the the impact, a flight from London to New York results in 6.2 MT. Conclusion(s): This proof of concept study demonstrates the impact of remote measurement of clinical parameters, Hb, Hct K+ and measuring latency of AV access using a alio smartpatch in the cost incurred by the care providers and notable reduction in the carbon emission. We aim to measure the impact from the other clinical sites and As CKD prevalence increases across the globe, these technologies will help the care providers to offer an effective and timely care to their patients.

J6256,2025,Identifying and Predicting Risk for Hospital Admission among Patients with Parkinsonism,"Background: Patients with parkinsonism are more likely than age-matched controls to be admitted to hospital. It may be possible to reduce the cost and negative impact by identifying patients at highest risk and intervening to reduce hospital-related costs. Predictive models have been developed in nonparkinsonism populations. Objective(s): The aims were to (1) describe the reasons for admission, (2) describe the rates of hospital admission/emergency department attendance over time, and (3) use routine data to risk stratify unplanned hospital attendance in people with parkinsonism. Method(s): This retrospective cohort study used Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD, a large UK primary care database, linked to hospital admission and emergency department attendance data. The primary diagnoses for nonelective admissions were categorized, and the frequencies were compared between parkinsonism cases and matched controls. Multilevel logistic and negative binomial regression models were used to estimate the risk of any and multiple admissions, respectively, for patients with parkinsonism. Result(s): There were 9189 patients with parkinsonism and 45,390 controls. The odds of emergency admission more than doubled from 2010 to 2019 (odds ratio [OR] 2.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.96, 2.76; P-value for trend <0.001). Pneumonia was the most common reason for admission among cases, followed by urinary tract infection. Increasing age, multimorbidity, parkinsonism duration, deprivation, and care home residence increased the odds of admission. Rural location was associated with reduced OR for admission (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.70, 0.89). Conclusion(s): Our risk stratification tool may enable empirical targeting of interventions to reduce admission risk for parkinsonism patients. Copyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© 2024 The Author(s).

J6257,2025,Interventions to reduce nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial sales in community pharmacies,"- Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global health concern. One of the most important causes of AMR is the excessive and inappropriate use of antimicrobial drugs in healthcare and community settings. Most countries have policies that require antimicrobial drugs to be obtained from a pharmacy by prescription. The term 'nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial sale' refers to the dispensing and selling of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription in countries where the pharmaceutical policy does not permit the sale of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription. Pharmacies, drugstores, and other medicine outlets are major sources of nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial sales in the community setting. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for reducing nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial sales by pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists in community pharmacies, drugstores, and other medicine outlets. To assess whether the effects of interventions differ according to types of interventions (single or multicomponent), community pharmacy personnel (pharmacists or nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists), and countries (low to lowerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂmiddleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âincome and upperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmiddle to high income). Search methods We searched five databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase, and two trial registers to 26 September 2022. We also conducted reference checking and citation searches. Selection criteria We included randomized trials, clusterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârandomized trials, and quasiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârandomized trials evaluating interventions targeted at pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists in community pharmacies, drugstores, and other medicine outlets. Our primary outcomes were nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial sales, symptomatic or asymptomatic infections caused by antimicrobialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âresistant pathogens among pharmacy clients or community residents, and adverse events associated with nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial drug use in pharmacy clients. Our secondary outcomes were history taking and provision of advice to pharmacy clients, and knowledge of pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methods. Main results We included four trials conducted in pharmacies and drugstores. Three studies were published between 2000 and 2010, and the fourth in 2016. In total, 942 community pharmacies and drugstores participated, including both pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists. One study conducted in Scotland was a fourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âarm trial that included educational outreach visits, continuing professional education, and a combination of both as interventions, in comparison to a control group supplied with guideline materials only. Two studies conducted in Portugal and Uganda compared the combination of training and distribution of written materials with a control of no intervention. One study conducted in Thailand and Vietnam compared a sequence of three interventions (regulatory enforcement, education, and peerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmonitoring) with a control of no intervention. Only nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial sales, history taking and provision of advice to pharmacy clients, and knowledge of pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists were assessed in the included studies; no study assessed other outcomes. We judged the overall risk of bias for nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial sales to be high risk and for the other two outcomes to be some concerns. One study conducted in Scotland assessed singleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent interventions (in two intervention arms) versus a control of written guidelines, and reported one primary outcome and one secondary outcome. NonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial sales: the study reported the sale or nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âsale of antifungal drugs according to simulated patient scenarios. It did not report any differences between the intervention and control groups for the scenarios in which antifungal drugs should not have been sold without a prescription. The certainty of evidence for this outcome was very low. Knowledge of pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists: the study reported knowledge scores at baseline and followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup, but did not compare the scores between t o singleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent intervention arms and the control arm at both time points. Four studies assessed multicomponent interventions versus a control of written guidelines or no intervention, and reported one primary outcome and two secondary outcomes. NonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial sales: two studies conducted in Uganda, Thailand, and Vietnam involving 337 randomized community pharmacies and drugstores reported the proportion of nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial sales to the total number of requests using a simulated client method. Based on vote counting, both studies favored the intervention, that is multicomponent interventions reduced the sales of nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial drugs by pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists. The information in the other two studies was inadequate to address this primary outcome. One study in Portugal reported that total antibiotic consumption at the municipal level (comprising both prescribed and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescribed antibiotic sales) was reduced after a multicomponent intervention. The study conducted in Scotland assessed a multicomponent intervention (in one intervention arm) and reported the sale or nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âsale of antifungal drugs according to simulated patient scenarios. It did not report any differences between the intervention and control groups for the scenarios in which antifungal drugs should not have been sold without a prescription. The certainty of evidence for this outcome was very low. History taking and provision of advice to pharmacy clients: two studies conducted in Uganda, Thailand, and Vietnam reported this outcome. In Thailand and Vietnam, there was an improvement in the practices of pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists in the intervention groups, while Uganda reported a paradoxical decline. Knowledge of pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists: the study conducted in Scotland reported knowledge scores at baseline and followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup, but did not compare the scores between the multicomponent intervention arm and control arm at both time points. Authors' conclusions No firm conclusions can be drawn about the effects of singleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent interventions due to limited evidence. Multicomponent interventions may not reduce the sales of nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âprescription antimicrobial drugs in community pharmacies, drugstores, and other medicine outlets; however, the evidence is of very low certainty. Further studies on this topic are needed, particularly to assess the effects of important single interventions such as improving pharmaceutical policies. Plain language summary What are the effects of interventions on sales of antimicrobial drugs without prescription in community pharmacies? Key messages ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ There is no clear evidence that the singleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent interventions targeted at pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists in community pharmacies and drugstores are effective. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ When multicomponent interventions are used, the sale of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription may not be reduced, but we are very uncertain about the results. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ BetterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality studies are needed to fully look at this topic. What is antimicrobial resistance? Antimicrobial drugs kill microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. They can be grouped according to the microorganism they primarily act against; for example, antibiotics are used against bacteria, and antivirals are used against viruses. Antimicrobial resistance is the ability of microorganisms to persist or grow in the presence of these drugs. Many microorganisms become resistant to antimicrobial drugs due to the misuse and overuse of these drugs, especially in community settings. In many countries, antimicrobial drugs are recommended to be sold only with a doctorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prescription, but some pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists in community pharmacies and drugstores do sell them without a prescription. However, it is important to note that laws vary between countries. Antimicrobial drugs can be obtained without a prescription in some countries for certain circumstances. We need to know which interventions are effective in helping pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âp armacists reduce the sale of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription in countries where laws do not permit the sale of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription. What did we want to find out? In this review we looked at whether interventions that target pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists in community pharmacies and drugstores can reduce the sale of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription. What did we do? We searched for published studies in which researchers looked at the effect of educational training, government regulations, financial incentives, or peerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmonitoring for reducing the sales of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription by pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists. We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our certainty in the evidence based on study methods and sizes. What did we find? We included four studies conducted in five countries: Portugal, Scotland, Thailand, Vietnam, and Uganda. The studies looked at three types of interventions at community pharmacies and drugstores: regulations on sales of antimicrobial drugs, education of pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists, and peerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âmonitoring on antimicrobial drug sales. When pharmacists and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âpharmacists in community pharmacies and drugstores received more than one intervention component, the number of sales of antimicrobial drugs without a prescription may not be reduced, but we are very uncertain about the results. No studies measured drugÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âresistant infections or unwanted effects of antimicrobial drugs in pharmacy users. Further studies on this topic are needed, particularly looking at the effects of singleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcomponent interventions. How upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdate is this review?

J6263,2025,"QbTest for ADHD assessment and medication management: A mixed-methods systematic review of impact on clinical outcomes and patient, carer and clinician experiences","Objectives To explore patient, carer and clinician experiences of the QbTest and its impact on patient outcomes for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis and medication management. Design Mixed-methods systematic review. Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP (from inception to September 2024). Study selection Primary studies, of any design, that evaluated any version of the QbTest (QbMini <5 years, QbTest 6-12 or 12-60 years, QbCheck for remote assessment via webcam or QbMT smartphone version), for ADHD diagnosis and/or medication management and provided data on any of the following outcomes, were eligible: time to assessment/diagnostic decision, use of services, impact on clinical decision-making, healthcare professionals' confidence in assessment, intervention use, morbidity, mortality, health-related quality of life, cost, ease of use, experience and acceptability of the test to patients, carers and clinicians. Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed potentially relevant reports for inclusion. One reviewer conducted data extraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment, checked by a second reviewer. Mixed-methods synthesis followed the convergent-integrated approach. Results We identified 10 eligible studies (9 QbTest; 1 QbCheck), including 1 randomised controlled trial (RCT), 2 feasibility RCTs, 5 before-And-After studies, 1 mixed-methods study and 1 diagnostic study. Most studies enrolled children in the UK and included surveys or interviews with patients, carers or clinicians. The RCT and before-And-After studies were judged at high/serious RoB. Six survey components and two qualitative interview components were judged at some concerns of RoB. We identified one ongoing study of the QbMT and no studies for QbMini. We organised themes emerging from the qualitative synthesis into two broad conceptual categories: views around the helpfulness of the QbTest (contribution to ADHD diagnosis, treatment decision-making, communication with caregivers) and barriers to QbTest implementation (practical barriers and acceptability of the test to patients and caregivers). Findings suggested that the addition of the QbTest may reduce time to diagnosis, improve clinician confidence in the diagnostic decision, increase the proportion of patients with a diagnostic decision and reduce cost and number of clinic appointments. The QbTest appeared to be generally well received by clinicians, patients and carers. However, barriers to test implementation were reported. Clinicians cited staffing, room requirements and issues with technology, and patients highlighted the test length and repetitive nature. Little data exist on the use of the QbTest for medication management. Conclusions The available evidence suggests the QbTest may be a useful addition to ADHD assessment in children and young people. Further well-designed RCTs with qualitative substudies are required to assess the impact of the QbTest on patient outcomes, user experience and cost, particularly for medication management and in adults, where evidence is scarce. Such RCTs should include economic analyses, direct comparisons to other continuous performance tests with motion trackers and subgroup analyses including age, sex, ethnicity and comorbidities.

J6264,2025,"The Post Op: Delivering the final mile of ERAS in Surgery""","Objectives: In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) provides free medical care to all legal UK residents, spending approximately 10% of its GDP on health. Given the substantial costs associated with hospital visits and inpatient stays, optimizing patient access to healthcare services and managing patient flow is critical. This study presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of a digital postoperative care pathway, focusing on the introduction of the 'Post Op' app, which connects post-surgery patients with their clinical teams for remote follow-up. This innovation aims to address the final mile"" of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathway. Method(s): The 'Post Op' app was piloted at a district general hospital, with patients encouraged to use the app for up to 60 days post-surgery. Data were collected through telephone surveys and anonymized questionnaires. Feedback indicated that over 70% of patients felt the app prevented unnecessary healthcare visits, primarily due to the reassurance provided. This finding aligns with qualitative studies suggesting improved patient satisfaction and fewer complications post op, although the direct financial impact had not been quantified prior to this study.Our cost-effectiveness analysis simulated populations with varying levels of postop anxiety and complications. The analysis considered costs associated with avoidable presentations to the Emergency Department (ED), environmental costs, and costs related to antibiotic tolerance and resistance due to late recognition of surgical site infections (SSIs). Result(s): The results demonstrated significant potential savings for NHS resources, estimating that a digitalized postoperative care pathway could save over 60,000 per 100 patients, even accounting for an increased number of outpatient follow-up visits. Key findings include the reduction of inappropriate medical care-seeking episodes, prevention of postoperative complication deterioration, mitigation of environmental costs linked to excessive hospital resource use and patient transport, and alleviation of costs borne by patients. Specifically, savings from avoided ED visits ranged from 22,225 to 43,435 per 100 patients, with additional savings from early detection of SSIs and prevention of antibiotic resistance estimated at 27,909 per 100 patients. Conclusion(s): The study concludes that the 'Post Op' app provides excellent support for postop patients, significantly reducing the number of unnecessary contacts with GPs, hospitals, and EDs. This results in substantial cost savings for both the NHS and patients. Additionally, the early recognition and treatment of SSIs through the app further enhance cost savings, highlighting the app's role in optimizing the final mile of the ERAS pathway. The digital postoperative follow-up tool not only improves patient outcomes but demonstrates a promising approach to healthcare delivery, aligning with the goals of cost efficiency, improving patient care within the NHS.

J6267,2025,Experiences of support to return to work after stroke: longitudinal case studies from RETAKE trial,"Background: Returning to work after stroke has physical, psychological and financial benefits for stroke survivors. However, global evidence estimates return-to-work rates 1 year post stroke at < 50%. Although its importance is acknowledged by policy-makers and healthcare providers, vocational rehabilitation is not always part of National Health Service usual care post stroke. Currently, there is limited evidence of the effectiveness of return-to-work support interventions. RETurn to work After stroKE was a multicentre individually randomised controlled pragmatic trial, with embedded process and health economic evaluations. RETurn to work After stroKE aimed to establish whether Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation plus usual care improves the likelihood of return to work at 12 months post stroke compared to usual care alone. As part of an embedded process evaluation, longitudinal case studies enabled exploration of participants' experiences of support to return to work in the trial. Objective(s): This article aims to understand participants' experiences of being supported to return to work and explores the social and structural factors which support, or act as barriers to, implementation of the Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation intervention. Method(s): A longitudinal case-study approach was used to compare experiences of post-stroke return-to-work support received over 12 months by 15 participants who received the Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation intervention plus usual care, and 11 participants who received usual care only. Data were gathered at three time points using follow-up questionnaires, health records, intervention delivery records and semistructured interviews with participants and seven nominated informal carers. Interviews were also conducted with 1 employer and 11 occupational therapists delivering the intervention. Setting(s): Sixteen National Health Service sites across England and Wales. Finding(s): In the intervention arm, stroke survivors, carers and employers reported benefits from information and support from the treating occupational therapist to facilitate acceptance of, and adaptation to, post-stroke abilities. Participants also valued occupational therapists' provision of sustained and tailored vocational rehabilitation, co-ordinating their care and advocating for them in return-to-work discussions with their employers. Those unable to return to their previous employment were supported to consider alternative options. In contrast, participants who received usual care only reported feeling abandoned when community rehabilitation support ended, typically after 2-8 weeks. Usual care largely focused on restoring physical function, leaving these participants struggling to find return-to-work information, advice and support. Longitudinal case studies enabled psychosocial and environmental factors impacting on participants' return-to-work experiences to be considered. Limitation(s): Recruitment to the process evaluation was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It proved difficult to recruit employers for interview, and fewer women participated in the case studies (21 men, 5 women). Direct observation of intervention delivery could not be carried out as planned due to pandemic restrictions on access to clinical areas. Conclusion(s): These case studies highlighted self-reported differences between recipients of the Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation intervention plus usual care and participants allocated to usual care only. Aspects perceived as important in underpinning the differences in support included the length of Early Stroke Specialist Vocational Rehabilitation intervention, occupational therapist advocacy, employer liaison and ongoing workplace monitoring. Provision of these core components as part of post-stroke services may support and help to sustain return to work, with associated benefits for stroke survivors and wider society.

J6279,2025,A personalized and systematically designed adherence intervention improves photoprotection in adults with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP): results of the XPAND randomized controlled trial,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: Poor adherence to photoprotection in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) increases morbidity and shortens lifespan due to skin cancers.
<b>OBJECTIVES</b>: To test a highly personalized intervention (XPAND) to reduce the dose of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the face in adults with XP, designed using known psychosocial determinants of poor photoprotection.
<b>METHODS</b>: A two-arm parallel group randomized controlled trial, including patients with suboptimal photoprotection to receive XPAND or a delayed-intervention control arm that received XPAND the following year. XPAND comprises seven 1 : 1 sessions targeting photoprotection barriers (e.g. misconceptions about UVR) supported by personalized text messages, activity sheets and educational materials incorporating behaviour change techniques. The primary outcome, mean daily UVR dose to face across 21 days in June-July 2018, was calculated by combining UVR exposure at the wrist with a face photoprotection activity diary. Secondary outcomes were UVR dose to face across 21 days in August 2018, time spent outside, photoprotective measures used outside, mood, automaticity and confidence to photoprotect. Financial costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated.
<b>RESULTS</b>: Sixteen patients were randomized; 13 provided sufficient data for primary outcome analysis. The XPAND group (n = 8) had lower mean daily UVR dose to face [0.03 standard error of difference (SED) (SD 0.02)] compared with controls (n = 7) [0.43 SED (SD 0.17)] (adjusted difference = -0.25, P < 0.001, Hedge's g = 2.21) at the June 2018 assessment. No significant between-group differences were observed in time spent outside, photoprotection outside, mood or confidence. The delayed-intervention control showed improvements in UVR dose to face (adjusted difference = -0.05; Hedge's g = -0.1), time outside (adjusted difference = -69.9; Hedge's g = -0.28) and photoprotection (adjusted difference = -0.23, Hedge's g = 0.45) after receiving XPAND (June 2019 assessment). XPAND was associated with lower treatment costs [-2642; 95% confidence interval (CI) -8715 to 3873] and fewer QALYs (-0.0141; 95% CI -0.0369 to 0.0028).

J6281,2025,"Clinical and cost-effectiveness of a home-based health promotion intervention for older people with mild frailty in England: a multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial","Background: Health promotion for people with mild frailty has the potential to improve health outcomes, but such services are scarce in practice. We developed a personalised, home-based, behaviour change, health promotion intervention (HomeHealth) and assessed its clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in maintaining independent functioning in activities of daily living in older adults with mild frailty. Method(s): This trial was an individual, multicentre, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial done in England. Participants were mainly recruited from general practices in three different areas of England (the London north Thames region, east and north Hertfordshire, and west Yorkshire). Participants were individuals residing in the community who were registered with a general practice, 65 years and older with mild frailty (scoring 5 on the CFS), with a life expectancy of more than 6 months, and with capacity to consent to participate. We excluded adults residing in nursing or care homes, those with moderate-to-severe frailty or with no frailty, those receiving palliative care, and those already case managed (eg, receiving a similar ongoing intervention from the voluntary sector or community service). Eligible participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to either the HomeHealth intervention or to treatment as usual. HomeHealth is a multidomain health promotion intervention delivered by the voluntary sector at home in six sessions over 6 months. The primary outcome was independent functioning (assessed using the modified Barthel Index [BI]) at 12 months. Outcome assessments were masked and were analysed by intention to treat using linear mixed models. Incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using seemingly unrelated regression and bootstrapping. The trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN54268283). Finding(s): We recruited 388 participants between Jan 8, 2021 and July 2, 2022 (mean age 81 years, SD 6.5; 249 (64%) of 388 were women and 139 (36%) were men). 195 participants were randomly assigned to HomeHealth and 193 to treatment as usual. Median follow-up was 363 days (IQR 356-370) in the HomeHealth group and 362 days (IQR 355-373) in the treatment-as-usual group. HomeHealth did not improve BI scores at 12 months (mean difference 0.250, 95% CI -0.932 to 1.432). HomeHealth was superior to treatment as usual with a negative point estimate for incremental costs (-796; 95% CI -2016 to 424) and positive point estimate for incremental QALYs (0.009, -0.021 to 0.039). There were 55 serious adverse events in the HomeHealth group and 85 in the treatment-as-usual group; none were intervention related. Interpretation(s): HomeHealth is a safe intervention with a high probability of cost-effectiveness, driven by a reduction in unplanned hospital admissions. HomeHealth should be considered as a health promotion intervention for older people with mild frailty. Funding(s): National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment.

J6282,2025,Impact and cost-effectiveness of scaling up HCV testing and treatment strategies for achieving HCV elimination among people who inject drugs in England: a mathematical modelling study,"Background: England aims to reach the World Health Organization (WHO) elimination target of decreasing HCV incidence among people who inject drugs (PWID) to <2 per 100 person-years (/100pyrs) by 2030. We assessed what testing and treatment strategies will achieve this target and whether they are cost-effective. Method(s): A dynamic deterministic HCV transmission model among PWID was developed for four England regions, utilising data on the scale-up of HCV treatment among PWID in prisons, drug treatment centres (DTC, where opioid agonist therapy is provided), and any other setting (e.g., primary care). The model projected whether the elimination target will be reached with existing testing and treatment initiatives ('status quo' model, SQ), or whether improvements are needed from 2024. Cost data was collated through practitioners' interviews and published literature. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER per quality adjusted life year (QALY) saved, 50-year time horizon; 3.5% discount rate) of SQ (assumes counterfactual of no treatment scale-up post-2015) and improved model (counterfactual: SQ model) was compared to a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000/QALY saved. Finding(s): The SQ model projects HCV incidence will decrease by 79.7-98.6% (range of medians) over 2015-2030 to 0.2-2.2/100pyrs, with an ICER of 308-1609/QALY saved across the regions. There is >80% probability of achieving the incidence target in three regions, and 40% probability in the other region. If annual testing in DTC increases to 80% (from 27%) or 75% of people get tested during their prison stay (from 55%) from 2024 in the lower impact region, then their probability increases to >65%, with both strategies being highly cost-effective. Interpretation(s): Many England regions could reach the WHO HCV elimination target by 2030 under existing testing and treatment pathways. Scaling up of testing in DTC or prisons will help achieve this target and is highly cost-effective. Funding(s): NIHR.

J6293,2025,Economic evaluation of personalised versus conventional risk assessment for women who have undergone testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer genes: A modelling study,"Background: The management of women with germline pathogenic variants (GPVs) in breast (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC) susceptibility genes is focused on surveillance and risk-reducing surgery/medication. Most women are assigned an average range of risk and treated accordingly, but it is possible to personalise this. Here, we explore the economic impact of risk personalisation. Method(s): We compared two strategies for risk stratification for female participants: conventional risk assessment (CRA), which only involves information from genetic testing and personalised risk assessment (PRA), using genetic and non-genetic risk modifiers. Three different versions of PRA were compared, which were combinations of polygenic risk score and questionnaire-based factors. A patient-level Markov model was designed to estimate the overall National Health Service cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) after risk assessment. Results were given for 20 different groups of women based on their GPV status and family history. Result(s): Across the 20 scenarios, the results showed that PRA was cost-effective compared with CRA using a 20 000 per QALY threshold in women with a GPV in PALB2 who have OC or BC+OC family history, and women with a GPV in ATM, CHEK2, RAD51C or RAD51D. For women with a GPV in BRCA1 or BRCA2, women with no pathogenic variant and women with a GPV in PALB2 who have unknown family history or BC family history, CRA was more cost-effective. PRA was cost-effective compared with CRA in specific situations predominantly associated with moderate-risk BC GPVs (RAD51C/RAD51D/CHEK2/ATM), while CRA was cost-effective compared with PRA predominantly with high-risk BC GPVs (BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2). Conclusion(s): PRA was cost-effective in specific situations compared with CRA in the UK for assessment of women with or without GPVs in BC and OC susceptibility genes.

J6299,2025,Economic evaluation of non-invasive test pathways for high-risk metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in the United Kingdom (UK),"Introduction and Objectives: Non-invasive tests (NITs) identifying high-risk MASLD in primary care is suggested but, these strategies cost-effectiveness remain uncertain in the United Kingdom (UK). Material(s) and Method(s): A cost-utility/budget impact model was developed for cost-effectiveness evaluation of two screening strategies (1) FIB-4 followed by Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) (FIB-4/ELF); (2) FIB-4 followed by Transient Elastography (FIB-4/TE) compared to standard of care (SoC). A cohort of primary care MASLD patients with an advanced fibrosis prevalence of 4.20 % was simulated. A decision tree classified patients as true positives, false positives, true negatives, or false negatives based on NIT diagnostic accuracy, followed by a 3-year Markov model to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The model included 11 health states: MASLD, fibrosis stages (F0-F3), cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplant, and death. Costs came from the National Tariff, National Schedule of Costs and Personal Social Services Research Unit. Result(s): SoC had a false diagnosis rate of 36.26 %, while FIB-4 with ELF or TE reduced false positive rates to 23.20 % and 20.91 %, respectively. Compared to 112,807 unnecessary hepatology referrals under SoC, FIB-4/ELF or FIB-4/TE reduced unnecessary referrals by 38,031 (33.71 %) and 45,767 (40.57 %), respectively. Both strategies demonstrated cost-effectiveness relative to SoC with total cost per patient of GBP 983.37 for FIB-4/TE, GBP 993.15 for FIB-4/ELF compared to SoC, GBP 1,014.15. Conclusion(s): Sequential NIT screening strategies, combining FIB-4 with ELF or TE, are cost-saving, reduce unnecessary hepatology referrals, and offer an efficient (improve outcomes and reduce healthcare costs) approach for managing high-risk MASLD in UK primary care.

J1789,2020,"Self-Monitoring and Management of Blood Pressure in Patients with Stroke or TIA: An Economic Evaluation of TEST-BP, A Randomised Controlled Trial","Background: Prevention of secondary stroke following initial ictus is an important focus of after-stroke care. Blood pressure (BP) is a key risk factor, so usual care following stroke or transient ischaemic attack includes regular BP checks and monitoring of anti-hypertensive medication. This is traditionally carried out in primary care, but the evidence supporting self-monitoring and self-guided management of BP in the general population with hypertension is growing. Objective(s): Our objective was to estimate the cost effectiveness of treatment as usual (TAU) versus (1) self-monitoring of BP (S-MON) and (2) self-monitoring and guided self-management of anti-hypertensive medication (S-MAN). Method(s): This was a within-trial economic evaluation of a randomised controlled trial estimating the incremental cost per 1 mmHg BP reduction and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over a 6-month time horizon from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). Result(s): Data were evaluable for 140 participants. Costs per patient were 473, 853 and 1035; mean reduction in systolic BP (SBP) was 3.6, 6.7 and 6.1 mmHg, and QALYs accrued were 0.427, 0.422 and 0.423 for TAU, S-MON and S-MAN, respectively. No statistically significant differences in incremental costs or outcomes were detected. On average, S-MAN was dominated or extended dominated. The incremental cost per 1 mmHg BP reduction from S-MON versus TAU was 137. Conclusion(s): On average, S-MAN is an inefficient intervention. S-MON may be cost effective, depending on the willingness to pay for a 1 mmHg BP reduction, although it yielded fewer QALYs over the within-trial time horizon. Decision modelling is required to explore the longer-term costs and outcomes.

J1793,2020,Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with liver cirrhosis: a network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis,"- Background Approximately 2.5% of all hospitalisations in people with liver cirrhosis are for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is associated with significant shortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm mortality; therefore, it is important to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people at high risk of developing it. Antibiotic prophylaxis forms the mainstay preventive method, but this has to be balanced against the development of drugÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âresistant spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is difficult to treat, and other adverse events. Several different prophylactic antibiotic treatments are available; however, there is uncertainty surrounding their relative efficacy and optimal combination. Objectives To compare the benefits and harms of different prophylactic antibiotic treatments for prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with liver cirrhosis using a network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis and to generate rankings of the different prophylactic antibiotic treatments according to their safety and efficacy. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and trials registers to November 2018 to identify randomised clinical trials in people with cirrhosis at risk of developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Selection criteria We included only randomised clinical trials (irrespective of language, blinding, or status) in adults with cirrhosis undergoing prophylactic treatment to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. We excluded randomised clinical trials in which participants had previously undergone liver transplantation, or were receiving antibiotics for treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or other purposes. Data collection and analysis We performed a network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis with OpenBUGS using Bayesian methods and calculated the odds ratio, rate ratio, and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% credible intervals (CrI) based on an availableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcase analysis, according to National Institute of Health and Care Excellence Decision Support Unit guidance. Main results We included 29 randomised clinical trials (3896 participants; nine antibiotic regimens (ciprofloxacin, neomycin, norfloxacin, norfloxacin plus neomycin, norfloxacin plus rifaximin, rifaximin, rufloxacin, sparfloxacin, sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim), and 'no active intervention' in the review. TwentyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âthree trials (2587 participants) were included in one or more outcomes in the review. The trials that provided the information included people with cirrhosis due to varied aetiologies, with or without other features of decompensation, having ascites with low protein or previous history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup in the trials ranged from 1 to 12 months. Many of the trials were at high risk of bias, and the overall certainty of evidence was low or very low. Overall, approximately 10% of trial participants developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and 15% of trial participants died. There was no evidence of differences between any of the antibiotics and no intervention in terms of mortality (very low certainty) or number of serious adverse events (very low certainty). However, because of the wide CrIs, clinically important differences in these outcomes cannot be ruled out. None of the trials reported healthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated quality of life or the proportion of people with serious adverse events. There was no evidence of differences between any of the antibiotics and no intervention in terms of proportion of people with 'any adverse events' (very low certainty), liver transplantation (very low certainty), or the proportion of people who developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (very low certainty). The number of 'any' adverse events per participant was fewer with norfloxacin (rate ratio 0.74, 95% CrI 0.59 to 0.94; 4 trials, 546 participants; low certainty) and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim (rate ratio 0.19, 95% CrI 0.02 to 0.81; 1 trial, 60 participants; low certainty) versus no activ intervention. There was no evidence of differences between the other antibiotics and no intervention in the number of 'any' adverse events per participant (very low certainty). There were fewer other decompensation events with rifaximin versus no active intervention (rate ratio 0.61, 65% CrI 0.46 to 0.80; 3 trials, 575 participants; low certainty) and norfloxacin plus neomycin (rate ratio 0.06, 95% CrI 0.00 to 0.33; 1 trial, 22 participants; low certainty). There was no evidence of differences between the other antibiotics and no intervention in the number of decompensations events per participant (very low certainty). None of the trials reported healthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated quality of life or development of symptomatic spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. One would expect some correlation between the above outcomes, with interventions demonstrating effectiveness across several outcomes. This was not the case. The possible reasons for this include sparse data and selective reporting bias, which makes the results unreliable. Therefore, one cannot draw any conclusions from these inconsistent differences based on sparse data. There was no evidence of any differences in the subgroup analyses (performed when possible) based on whether the prophylaxis was primary or secondary. Funding: the source of funding for five trials were organisations who would benefit from the results of the study; six trials received no additional funding or were funded by neutral organisations; and the source of funding for the remaining 18 trials was unclear. Authors' conclusions Based on very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, there is considerable uncertainty about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is beneficial, and if beneficial, which antibiotic prophylaxis is most beneficial in people with cirrhosis and ascites with low protein or history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Future randomised clinical trials should be adequately powered, employ blinding, avoid postrandomisation dropouts (or perform intentionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âtreat analysis), and use clinically important outcomes such as mortality, healthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated quality of life, and decompensation events. Plain language summary Use of antibiotics to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with advanced liver disease What was the aim of this Cochrane Review? People with advanced liver disease (liver cirrhosis, or lateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstage scarring of the liver with complications) are at risk of developing an abnormal buildÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup of fluid in the tummy, called ascites. This fluid may get infected with bacteria, without one knowing the cause. This is called 'spontaneous bacterial peritonitis'. It is important to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people at high risk of developing it, because it is associated with a significant risk of death. Antibiotics are often used in people with advanced liver disease and ascites as a means to help prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but it is unclear whether they are effective and if effective, which antibiotic is the most effective. We aimed to determine the best available antibiotic treatment (if any) for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in people with advanced liver disease. We collected and analysed all relevant research studies and found 29 randomised clinical trials (participants are randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups). During analysis of data, we used standard Cochrane techniques, allowing direct comparison of only two treatments at a time. We also used advanced techniques, allowing indirect comparisons of more than two treatments simultaneously (usually referred as 'network metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis'). The aim was to gather reliable direct and indirect evidence. Date of literature search November 2018. Key messages Only two small studies were conducted without flaws, and because of the very high uncertainty in the obtained analysis results, the authors could not say whether antibiotics work and, if they work, which one to use. Out of 1564 participants, 10% of people with cirrhosis and ascites developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and out f 2169 participants, about 15% died within 12 months. Funding source was unclear in 18 studies. Drug companies funded five studies. There were no concerns regarding the source of funding for the remaining six studies. What did the review study? We studied adults with advanced liver disease due to various causes, and who were undergoing preventive treatment to avoid developing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Participants received different antibiotics or no antibiotics. We excluded studies in people who had previously undergone liver transplantation, and where people received antibiotics for the treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or for any other reason. The average age of participants, when reported, ranged from 42 to 63 years. The administered antibiotic types were quinolones, rifamycins, sulfonamides, and aminoglycosides. The authors wanted to gather and analyse data on death, quality of life, serious and nonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âserious side effects, time to liver transplantation, time to development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, time to development of other complications of advanced liver disease, and length of hospital stay. What were the main results of the review? The 29 studies included a small number of participants (3896 participants). Study data were sparse. TwentyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âthree studies with 2587 participants provided data for analyses. The followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup in the trials ranged from 1 to 12 months.

J1800,2020,Interventions to reduce contaminated aerosols produced during dental procedures for preventing infectious diseases,"- Background Many dental procedures produce aerosols (droplets, droplet nuclei and splatter) that harbour various pathogenic microÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âorganisms and may pose a risk for the spread of infections between dentist and patient. The COVIDÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â19 pandemic has led to greater concern about this risk. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of methods used during dental treatment procedures to minimize aerosol production and reduce or neutralize contamination in aerosols. Search methods Cochrane Oral HealthÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Information Specialist searched the following databases on 17 September 2020: Cochrane Oral HealthÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library, 2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946); Embase Ovid (from 1980); the WHO COVIDÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â19 Global literature on coronavirus disease; the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov); and the Cochrane COVIDÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â19 Study Register. We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication. Selection criteria We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) on aerosolÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âgenerating procedures (AGPs) performed by dental healthcare providers that evaluated methods to reduce contaminated aerosols in dental clinics (excluding preprocedural mouthrinses). The primary outcomes were incidence of infection in dental staff or patients, and reduction in volume and level of contaminated aerosols in the operative environment. The secondary outcomes were cost, accessibility and feasibility. Data collection and analysis Two review authors screened search results, extracted data from the included studies, assessed the risk of bias in the studies, and judged the certainty of the available evidence. We used mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect estimate for continuous outcomes, and randomÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âeffects metaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âanalysis to combine data. We assessed heterogeneity. Main results We included 16 studies with 425 participants aged 5 to 69 years. Eight studies had high risk of bias; eight had unclear risk of bias. No studies measured infection. All studies measured bacterial contamination using the surrogate outcome of colonyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âforming units (CFU). Two studies measured contamination per volume of air sampled at different distances from the patient's mouth, and 14 studies sampled particles on agar plates at specific distances from the patient's mouth. The results presented below should be interpreted with caution as the evidence is very low certainty due to heterogeneity, risk of bias, small sample sizes and wide confidence intervals. Moreover, we do not know the 'minimal clinically important difference' in CFU. HighÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âvolume evacuator Use of a highÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âvolume evacuator (HVE) may reduce bacterial contamination in aerosols less than one foot (~ 30 cm) from a patient's mouth (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢47.41, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢92.76 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢2.06; 3 splitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âmouth RCTs, 122 participants; very high heterogeneity IÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â² = 95%), but not at longer distances (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢1.00, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢2.56 to 0.56; 1 RCT, 80 participants). One splitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âmouth RCT (six participants) found that HVE may not be more effective than conventional dental suction (saliva ejector or lowÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âvolume evacuator) at 40 cm (MD CFU ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢2.30, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢5.32 to 0.72) or 150 cm (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢2.20, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢14.01 to 9.61). Dental isolation combination system One RCT (50 participants) found that there may be no difference in CFU between a combination system (Isolite) and a saliva ejector (lowÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âvolume evacuator) during AGPs (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢0.31, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢0.82 to 0.20) or after AGPs (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢0.35, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢0.99 to 0.29). However, an 'n of 1' design study showed that the combination system may reduce CFU compared with rubber dam plus HVE (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢125.20, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢174.02 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢76.38) or HVE (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢109.30, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢153.01 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢65.59). Rubber dam One splitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âmouth RCT (10 participants) receiving dental treatment, found that there may be a reduction in CFU with rubber dam at oneÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âmetre (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢16.20, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢19.36 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢13.04) and twoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âmetre distance (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢11.70, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â  15.82 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢7.58). One RCT of 47 dental students found use of rubber dam may make no difference in CFU at the forehead (MD 0.98, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢0.73 to 2.70) and occipital region of the operator (MD 0.77, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢0.46 to 2.00). One splitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âmouth RCT (21 participants) found that rubber dam plus HVE may reduce CFU more than cotton roll plus HVE on the patient's chest (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢251.00, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢267.95 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢234.05) and dental unit light (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢12.70, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢12.85 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢12.55). Air cleaning systems One splitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âmouth CCT (two participants) used a local standÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âalone air cleaning system (ACS), which may reduce aerosol contamination during cavity preparation (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢66.70 CFU, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢120.15 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢13.25 per cubic metre) or ultrasonic scaling (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢32.40, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 51.55 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢13.25). Another CCT (50 participants) found that laminar flow in the dental clinic combined with a HEPA filter may reduce contamination approximately 76 cm from the floor (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢483.56 CFU, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢550.02 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢417.10 per cubic feet per minute per patient) and 20 cm to 30 cm from the patient's mouth (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢319.14 CFU, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â 385.60 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢252.68). Disinfectants ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ antimicrobial coolants Two RCTs evaluated use of antimicrobial coolants during ultrasonic scaling. Compared with distilled water, coolant containing chlorhexidine (CHX), cinnamon extract coolant or povidone iodine may reduce CFU: CHX (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢124.00, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢135.78 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢112.22; 20 participants), povidone iodine (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢656.45, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢672.74 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢640.16; 40 participants), cinnamon (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢644.55, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢668.70 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢620.40; 40 participants). CHX coolant may reduce CFU more than povidone iodine (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢59.30, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢64.16 to ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢54.44; 20 participants), but not more than cinnamon extract (MD ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢11.90, 95% CI ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢35.88 to 12.08; 40 participants). Authors' conclusions We found no studies that evaluated disease transmission via aerosols in a dental setting; and no evidence about viral contamination in aerosols. All of the included studies measured bacterial contamination using colonyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âforming units. There appeared to be some benefit from the interventions evaluated but the available evidence is very low certainty so we are unable to draw reliable conclusions. We did not find any studies on methods such as ventilation, ionization, ozonisation, UV light and fogging. Studies are needed that measure contamination in aerosols, size distribution of aerosols and infection transmission risk for respiratory diseases such as COVIDÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â19 in dental patients and staff. Plain language summary Do measures that aim to reduce aerosol production during dental procedures prevent the transmission of infectious diseases? Why is this question important? Most dental care procedures create tiny drops of liquid that float in the air, called aerosols. For example, to remove the film of bacteria (plaque) that builds on teeth, dentists use scaling machines (scalers). Scalers vibrate at high speed and use a flow of water to wash away the plaque. This produces aerosols that are made of air, water, and the patientÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s saliva, which may also contain microÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. Aerosols that contain bacteria, fungi or viruses can spread infectious diseases. Limiting the production of these aerosols could help to prevent disease transmission in a dental setting. A range of approaches can be used to reduce production of potentially infectious aerosols during dental procedures. These include: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â ways to decontaminate the mouth before aerosols are produced, for example by using antiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âmicrobial mouthwash; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â ways to prevent aerosols from leaving the mouth (for example, placing a rubber sheet ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ known as a ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œdamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ around the tooth that is to be treated, to isolate the treatment zone from saliva; or using a strawÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âlike suction tube known as a saliva ejector); ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â local ventilation using a suction device (known as a highÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âvolume evacuator) that draws up a large volume of air and evacuates aerosols from the treatment zone; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â general ventilation, to reduce the concentration of aerosols in t e air, for example by keeping windows open; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â decontamination of airÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âborne aerosols, for example using ultraviolet light to sterilize the air. These can be used alone, or in combination. We analysed the evidence from research studies to find out whether interventions that aim to reduce aerosol production during dental procedures can prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. We also wanted to find out about the cost of the interventions, whether patients and dentists found them acceptable, and whether the interventions were easy to implement. How did we identify and evaluate the evidence? First, we searched for all relevant studies in the medical literature that compared interventions to reduce aerosol production during dental procedures against other interventions or no intervention. We then compared the results, and summarized the evidence from all the studies. Finally, we assessed how certain the evidence was. To do this, we considered factors such as the way studies were conducted, study sizes, and consistency of findings across studies. Based on our assessments, we categorized the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. What did we find? We found 16 studies that involved a total of 425 people. Studies involved between one and 80 participants, who were aged between 5 and 69 years. Six studies were conducted in the USA, five in India, two in the UK and one each in Egypt, the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates. The studies evaluated one or more of the following devices: ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â highÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âvolume evacuator (7 studies); ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â handsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âfree suction device (2 studies); ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â saliva ejector (1 study); ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â rubber dam (3 studies); ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â rubber dam with a highÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âvolume evacuator (1 study); or ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â air cleaning system (1 study). None of the studies evaluated the risk infectious disease transmission. Nor did they evaluate cost, acceptability or ease of implementation. All 16 studies measured changes in the levels of bacterial contamination in aerosols, but we assessed the evidence as being of very low certainty. This means that we have very little confidence in the evidence, and that we expect further research to change the findings of our review. We therefore cannot deduce from this evidence whether there is an effect on levels of bacterial contamination. No studies investigated viral or fungal contamination. What does this mean? We do not know whether interventions that aim to reduce aerosol production during dental procedures prevent the transmission of infectious diseases. This review highlights the need for more and betterÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âquality studies in this area. How up to date is this review?

J1801,2020,Improving Workflow Efficiency for Mammography Using Machine Learning,"Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether machine learning could reduce the number of mammograms the radiologist must read by using a machine-learning classifier to correctly identify normal mammograms and to select the uncertain and abnormal examinations for radiological interpretation. Method(s): Mammograms in a research data set from over 7,000 women who were recalled for assessment at six UK National Health Service Breast Screening Program centers were used. A convolutional neural network in conjunction with multitask learning was used to extract imaging features from mammograms that mimic the radiological assessment provided by a radiologist, the patient's nonimaging features, and pathology outcomes. A deep neural network was then used to concatenate and fuse multiple mammogram views to predict both a diagnosis and a recommendation of whether or not additional radiological assessment was needed. Result(s): Ten-fold cross-validation was used on 2,000 randomly selected patients from the data set; the remainder of the data set was used for convolutional neural network training. While maintaining an acceptable negative predictive value of 0.99, the proposed model was able to identify 34% (95% confidence interval, 25%-43%) and 91% (95% confidence interval: 88%-94%) of the negative mammograms for test sets with a cancer prevalence of 15% and 1%, respectively. Conclusion(s): Machine learning was leveraged to successfully reduce the number of normal mammograms that radiologists need to read without degrading diagnostic accuracy.

J1807,2020,Telerehabilitation services for stroke,"- Background Telerehabilitation offers an alternate way of delivering rehabilitation services. Information and communication technologies are used to facilitate communication between the healthcare professional and the patient in a remote location. The use of telerehabilitation is becoming more viable as the speed and sophistication of communication technologies improve. However, it is currently unclear how effective this model of delivery is relative to rehabilitation delivered faceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âface or when added to usual care. Objectives To determine whether the use of telerehabilitation leads to improved ability to perform activities of daily living amongst stroke survivors when compared with (1) inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âperson rehabilitation (when the clinician and the patient are at the same physical location and rehabilitation is provided faceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âface); or (2) no rehabilitation or usual care. Secondary objectives were to determine whether use of telerehabilitation leads to greater independence in selfÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcare and domestic life and improved mobility, balance, healthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated quality of life, depression, upper limb function, cognitive function or functional communication when compared with inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âperson rehabilitation and no rehabilitation. Additionally, we aimed to report on the presence of adverse events, costÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffectiveness, feasibility and levels of user satisfaction associated with telerehabilitation interventions. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (June 2019), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (the Cochrane Library , Issue 6, 2019), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to June 2019), Embase (1974 to June 2019), and eight additional databases. We searched trial registries and reference lists. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of telerehabilitation in stroke. We included studies that compared telerehabilitation with inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âperson rehabilitation or no rehabilitation. In addition, we synthesised and described the results of RCTs that compared two different methods of delivering telerehabilitation services without an alternative group. We included rehabilitation programmes that used a combination of telerehabilitation and inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âperson rehabilitation provided that the greater proportion of intervention was provided via telerehabilitation. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently identified trials on the basis of prespecified inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A third review author moderated any disagreements. The review authors contacted investigators to ask for missing information. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence and interpret findings. Main results We included 22 trials in the review involving a total of 1937 participants. The studies ranged in size from the inclusion of 10 participants to 536 participants, and reporting quality was often inadequate, particularly in relation to random sequence generation and allocation concealment. Selective outcome reporting and incomplete outcome data were apparent in several studies . Study interventions and comparisons varied, meaning that, in many cases, it was inappropriate to pool studies. Intervention approaches included postÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhospital discharge support programs, upper limb training, lower limb and mobility retraining and communication therapy for people with postÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âstroke language disorders. Studies were either conducted upon discharge from hospital or with people in the subacute or chronic phases following stroke. Primary outcome: we found moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence that there was no difference in activities of daily living between people who received a postÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhospital discharge telerehabilitation intervention and those who received usual care (based on 2 studies with 661 participants (standardised mean difference (SMD) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.15 to 0.15)). We found lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence of no difference in effects on activities of daily living between telerehabilitation and inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âperson physical therapy programmes (based on 2 studies w th 75 participants: SMD 0.03, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.43 to 0.48). Secondary outcomes: we found a low quality of evidence that there was no difference between telerehabilitation and inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âperson rehabilitation for balance outcomes (based on 3 studies with 106 participants: SMD 0.08, 95%CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.30 to 0.46). Pooling of three studies with 569 participants showed moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence that there was no difference between those who received postÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdischarge support interventions and those who received usual care on healthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated quality of life (SMD 0.03, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.14 to 0.20). Similarly, pooling of six studies (with 1145 participants) found moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence that there was no difference in depressive symptoms when comparing postÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdischarge teleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âsupport programs with usual care (SMD ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.04, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.19 to 0.11). We found no difference between groups for upper limb function (based on 3 studies with 170 participants: mean difference (MD) 1.23, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â2.17 to 4.64, lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âquality evidence) when a computer program was used to remotely retrain upper limb function in comparison to inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âperson therapy. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of telerehabilitation on mobility or participant satisfaction with the intervention. No studies evaluated the costÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffectiveness of telerehabilitation; however, five of the studies reported health service utilisation outcomes or costs of the interventions provided within the study. Two studies reported on adverse events, although no serious trialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated adverse events were reported. Authors' conclusions While there is now an increasing number of RCTs testing the efficacy of telerehabilitation, it is hard to draw conclusions about the effects as interventions and comparators varied greatly across studies. In addition, there were few adequately powered studies and several studies included in this review were at risk of bias. At this point, there is only low or moderateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âlevel evidence testing whether telerehabilitation is a more effective or similarly effective way to provide rehabilitation. ShortÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âterm postÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âhospital discharge telerehabilitation programmes have not been shown to reduce depressive symptoms, improve quality of life, or improve independence in activities of daily living when compared with usual care. Studies comparing telerehabilitation and inÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âperson therapy have also not found significantly different outcomes between groups, suggesting that telerehabilitation is not inferior. Some studies reported that telerehabilitation was less expensive to provide but information was lacking about costÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffectiveness. Only two trials reported on whether or not any adverse events had occurred; these trials found no serious adverse events were related to telerehabilitation. The field is still emerging and more studies are needed to draw more definitive conclusions. In addition, while this review examined the efficacy of telerehabilitation when tested in randomised trials, studies that use mixed methods to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of telehealth interventions are incredibly valuable in measuring outcomes. Plain language summary Telerehabilitation services for stroke Review question ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ This review aimed to gather evidence for the use of telerehabilitation after stroke. We aimed to compare telerehabilitation with therapy delivered faceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âface and with no therapy (usual care). Background ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ Stroke is a common cause of disability in adults. After a stroke, it is common for the individual to have difficulty managing everyday activities such as walking, showering, dressing, and participating in community activities. Many people need rehabilitation after stroke; this is usually provided by healthcare professionals in a hospital or clinic setting. Recent studies have investigated whether it is possible to use technologies such as the telephone or the Internet to help people communicate with healthcare professionals without having to leave their home. This approach, which is called telerehabilitation, may be a more convenient and less xpensive way of providing rehabilitation. Telerehabilitation may be used to improve a range of outcomes including physical functioning and mood. Study characteristics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ We searched for studies in June 2019 and identified 22 studies involving 1937 people after stroke. The studies used a wide range of treatments, including therapy programmes designed to improve arm function and ability to walk and programmes designed to provide counselling and support for people upon leaving hospital after stroke. Key results ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ As the studies were very different, it was rarely appropriate to combine results to determine overall effect. We found that people who received telerehabilitation had similar outcomes for activities of daily living function to those that received faceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ÂtoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âface therapy and those that received no therapy (usual care). At this point, not enough research has been done to show whether telerehabilitation is a more effective way to provide rehabilitation. Some studies report that telerehabilitation is less expensive to provide but information is lacking about costÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âeffectiveness. Only two trials reported on whether or not any adverse events had occurred; these trials found no serious adverse events were related to telerehabilitation. Further trials are required. Quality of the evidence ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ The quality of the evidence was generally of low or moderate quality.

J3599,2022,A psychological intervention by community pharmacies to prevent depression in adults with subthreshold depression and long-term conditions: the CHEMIST pilot RCT,"<b>BACKGROUND</b>: Depression is common in people with long-term health conditions, and this combination can lead to worsened health outcomes and increased health-care costs. Subthreshold depression, a risk factor for major depression, is prevalent in this population, but many people remain untreated due to the demand on services. The community pharmacy may be an alternative setting to offer mental health support; however, insufficient evidence exists to support implementation.
<b>OBJECTIVES</b>: To conduct a feasibility study and pilot randomised controlled trial of a community pharmacy-delivered psychological intervention aimed at preventing depression in adults with long-term health conditions.
<b>DESIGN</b>: A feasibility study with nested qualitative evaluation and an external pilot, two-arm, 1 : 1 individually randomised controlled trial with nested process and economic evaluations.
<b>SETTING</b>: Community pharmacies in the north of England.
<b>PARTICIPANTS</b>: Adults aged >= 18 years with subthreshold depression and at least one long-term health condition.
<b>INTERVENTION</b>: A bespoke enhanced support intervention (behavioural activation within a collaborative care framework) involving up to six sessions delivered by trained community pharmacy staff (intervention facilitators) compared with usual care.
<b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</b>: Recruitment and retention rates, completeness of outcome measures and intervention engagement. The intended primary outcome was depression severity at 4 months, assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9.
<b>RESULTS</b>: In the feasibility study, 24 participants were recruited. Outcome measure completeness was 95-100%. Retention at 4 months was 83%. Seventeen participants (71%) commenced intervention sessions and all completed two or more sessions. Depression symptoms reduced slightly at 4 months. The process evaluation suggested that the intervention was acceptable to participants and intervention facilitators. In the pilot randomised controlled trial, 44 participants (target of 100 participants) were randomised (intervention, n = 24; usual care, n = 20). Outcome measure completeness was 100%. Retention at 4 months was 93%. Eighteen participants (75%) commenced intervention sessions and 16 completed two or more sessions. Depression symptoms reduced slightly at 4 months, with a slightly larger reduction in the usual-care arm, although the small sample size limits any conclusions. The process evaluation reported good acceptability of the intervention and identified barriers associated with study implementation and its impact on core pharmacy functions. The economic analysis revealed some indication of reduced resource use/costs associated with the intervention, but this is limited by the small sample size. Intervention costs were low.
<b>LIMITATIONS</b>: The main limitation is the small sample size due to difficulties with recruitment and barriers to implementing the study within existing pharmacy practices.
<b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: The community pharmacy represents a new setting to deliver a depression prevention intervention. Recruitment was a challenge and pharmacy staff encountered barriers to effective implementation of the study within busy pharmacy practice. Despite these challenges, good retention rates and intervention engagement were demonstrated, and process evaluation suggested that the intervention was acceptable in this setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that community pharmacy staff can be trained to deliver a depression prevention intervention.
<b>FUTURE WORK</b>: Further work is needed to address barriers to recruitment, intervention delivery and implementation of psychological interventions in the community pharmacy setting.
<b>TRIAL REGISTRATION</b>: This trial is registered as ISRCTN11290592.

J3606,2022,A multidomain decision support tool to prevent falls in older people: the FinCH cluster RCT,"Background: Falls in care home residents are common, unpleasant, costly and difficult to prevent. Objective(s): The objectives were to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Guide to Action for falls prevention in Care Homes (GtACH) programme. Design(s): A multicentre, cluster, parallel, 1: 1 randomised controlled trial with embedded process evaluation and economic evaluation. Care homes were randomised on a 1: 1 basis to the GtACH programme or usual care using a secure web-based randomisation service. Research assistants, participating residents and staff informants were blind to allocation at recruitment; research assistants were blind to allocation at follow-up. NHS Digital data were extracted blindly. Setting(s): Older people's care homes from 10 UK sites. Participant(s): Older care home residents. Intervention(s): The GtACH programme, which includes care home staff training, systematic use of a multidomain decision support tool and implementation of falls prevention actions, compared to usual falls prevention care. Outcome(s): The primary trial outcome was the rate of falls per participating resident occurring during the 90-day period between 91 and 180 days post randomisation. The primary outcome for the cost-effectiveness analysis was the cost per fall averted, and the primary outcome for the cost-utility analysis was the incremental cost per quality adjusted life-year. Secondary outcomes included the rate of falls over days 0-90 and 181-360 post randomisation, activity levels, dependency and fractures. The number of falls per resident was compared between arms using a negative binomial regression model (generalised estimating equation). Result(s): A total of 84 care homes were randomised: 39 to the GtACH arm and 45 to the control arm. A total of 1657 residents consented and provided baseline measures (mean age 85 years, 32% men). GtACH programme training was delivered to 1051 staff (71% of eligible staff) over 146 group sessions. Primary outcome data were available for 630 GtACH participants and 712 control participants. The primary outcome result showed an unadjusted incidence rate ratio of 0.57 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.71; p < 0.01) in favour of the GtACH programme. Falls rates were lower in the GtACH arm in the period 0-90 days. There were no other differences between arms in the secondary outcomes. Care home staff valued the training, systematic strategies and specialist peer support, but the incorporation of the GtACH programme documentation into routine care home practice was limited. No adverse events were recorded. The incremental cost was 20,889.42 per Dementia Specific Quality of Life-based quality-adjusted life-year and 4543.69 per quality-adjusted life-year based on the EuroQol-5 dimensions, five-level version. The mean number of falls was 1.889 (standard deviation 3.662) in the GtACH arm and 2.747 (standard deviation 7.414) in the control arm. Therefore, 0.858 falls were averted. The base-case incremental cost per fall averted was 190.62. Conclusion(s): The GtACH programme significantly reduced the falls rate in the study care homes without restricting residents' activity levels or increasing their dependency, and was cost-effective at current thresholds in the NHS.

J3609,2022,Heparin versus 0.9% sodium chloride locking for prevention of occlusion in central venous catheters in adults,"- Background Intermittent locking of central venous catheters (CVCs) is undertaken to help maintain their patency and performance. There are systematic variations in care: some practitioners use heparin (at different concentrations), whilst others use 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline). This review looks at the effectiveness and safety of intermittent locking with heparin compared to normal saline, to see if the evidence establishes whether one is better than the other. This is an update of an earlier Cochrane Review. Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of intermittent locking of CVCs with heparin versus normal saline in adults to prevent occlusion. Search methods We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 20 October 2021. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials in adults ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Â°Ã‚Â¥ 18 years of age with a CVC that compared intermittent locking with heparin at any concentration versus normal saline. We excluded studies on infants and children from this review. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were occlusion of CVCs and duration of catheter patency. Our secondary outcomes were CVCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated bloodstream infections and CVCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated colonisation, mortality, haemorrhage, heparinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âinduced thrombocytopaenia, CVCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated thrombosis, number of additional CVC insertions, abnormality of coagulation profile and allergic reactions to heparin. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Main results We identified one new RCT with 30 participants for this update. We included a total of 12 RCTs with 2422 participants. Data for metaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âanalysis were available from all RCTs. We noted differences in methods used by the included studies and variation in heparin concentrations (10 to 5000 IU/mL), time to followÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âup (1 to 251.8 days), and the unit of analysis used (participant, catheter, line access). Five studies included ICU (intensive care unit) patients, two studies included oncology patients, and the remaining studies included miscellaneous patients (chronic kidney disease, haemodialysis, home care patients, etc.). Primary outcomes Overall, combined results may show fewer occlusions with heparin compared to normal saline but this is uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.95; 10 studies; 1672 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). We pooled studies that used participant or catheter as the unit of analysis. We carried out subgroup analysis by unit of analysis. No clear differences were detected after testing for subgroup differences (P = 0.23). We found no clear evidence of a difference in the duration of catheter patency with heparin compared to normal saline (mean difference (MD) 0.44 days, 95% CI ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â0.10 to 0.99; 6 studies; 1788 participants; lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). Secondary outcomes We found no clear evidence of a difference in the following outcomes: CVCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated bloodstream infections (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.08 to 5.80; 3 studies; 1127 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence); mortality (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.31; 3 studies; 1100 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence); haemorrhage (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.41 to 5.74; 3 studies; 1197 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence); or heparinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âinduced thrombocytopaenia (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.27; 3 studies; 443 participants; very lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence). The main reasons for downgrading the certainty of evidence for the primary and secondary outcomes were unclear allocation concealment, suspicion of publication bias, imprecision and inconsistency. Authors' conclusions Given the lowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence, we are uncertain whether intermittent locking with heparin results in fewer central venous catheter occlusions than intermittent locking with normal saline in adults. LowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âcertainty evidence suggests that heparin may have little or no effect on catheter patency duration. Although we found no evidence of differences in safety (CVCÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated bloodstream infections, mortality, or haemorrha e), the combined studies were not powered to detect rare adverse events such as heparinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âinduced thrombocytopaenia. Further research conducted over longer periods would reduce the current uncertainties. Plain language summary Does heparin locking prevent blocking of central venous catheters in adults when compared to locking with normal saline? Key message We did not find clear evidence of a difference between heparin and normal saline solution (sterile solution of salt in water) in preventing central venous catheter blockages (occlusions), or in the length of time catheters remained unblocked, or in the number of side effects such as infections, death, bleeding, etc. Further wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âdesigned, largeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Âscale studies are required to reduce uncertainties. Why is this question important? Central venous catheters are tubes (also called 'lines') that must be temporarily placed into the veins of patients whose veins need to be accessed regularly for medical reasons. These are inserted into the great vessels leading to the heart. While not in use, a fluid is injected into the catheter until it is next used to avoid blood clots that can block the catheter. This is called locking catheters. Replacement of catheters adds to the cost of care, may delay treatment, and poses an additional risk of catheterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Ârelated adverse events to the patient. The catheter may also become infected, resulting in bloodstream infections. Fluids used for locking are heparin or normal saline. Heparin, which is an anticoagulant, is used to prevent clotting of the blood. It may also help to prevent the catheters from blocking; however, it can also cause bleeding, allergic reactions, and a drop in the number of platelets in the blood. This has raised the question whether heparin is better than saline to avoid blockages, and how safe each method is. What did we do? We searched for randomised controlled trials that assessed whether locking catheters with heparin was more effective in reducing the risk of blocking and infections compared to normal saline. In randomised controlled trials, the treatments people receive are decided at random and these give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects. What we did find? We found one new study for this update. In total, we included 12 studies with 2422 people. Five studies included ICU patients, two studies included cancer patients, and the remaining studies included miscellaneous patients (haemodialysis, home care patients, etc.). We cannot conclude that locking catheters with heparin prevents blocking better than flushing with normal saline. We saw little or no difference in the length of time the catheter remained unblocked or in the numbers of side effects between heparin or saline use. How certain are we with the evidence? When comparing heparin with saline, the certainty of the evidence of the results ranged from very low to low due to the design of the studies and because the overall result included the likelihood of both benefit and harm. How up to date is the evidence? This Cochrane review updates our previous evidence.

J3610,2022,Predicting the cost impact of dose individualisation associated with pharmacogenetic testing to avoid adverse drug reactions in a specialist cancer centre - a methodological template,"Introduction: Pre-emptive pharmacogenetic testing can help minimise adverse drug reactions (ADRs) however most economic evaluations exploring its cost-effectiveness are based on single-pharmacogene testing.1,2 Currently, there is no nationally established multi-gene panel testing for ADR gene-drug pairs to guide dose individualisation, mainly due to lack of robust economic evidence.3 Economic modelling frameworks require detailed considerations of all the eventualities in health outcomes to fully assess the impact of implementing pharmacogenetic testing in avoiding ADRs.4 The relevance of such framework is dependent on the perspective of the policymakers, particularly when full economic evaluation is not feasible or when decision-making process only requires information pertaining to the short-term cost impact of implementing a new healthcare intervention. Objectives * To assess the cost impact associated with dose individualisation based on acting upon result findings of pharmacogenetic panel testing in a specialist cancer centre. * To evaluate the range in cost impact and identify contributing factors to consider when prioritising drug-gene pairs for panel testing. Methods * Identify dispensing data for clinically actionable (Level A evidence) drug-gene pairs from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) between April 2019 - April 2020. [5] Clinical trials prescriptions were excluded. * Calculate the total expenditure spent on the studied population based on mean prescribed dose for each drug using costs from British National Formulary (BNF). [6] * Calculate the total expenditure after implementing dose individualisation in affected population based on population prevalence of the gene-drug pair variants and CPIC prescribing guidelines. [5] * Compare cost difference between total expenditures before and after adjusting for genetic findings. Results/Key findings: Between April 2019 and 2020, a total of 8173 patients (68,200 prescriptions) were prescribed with one of the eleven drugs identified (Table 1). Evaluation of cost savings through geneticbased dose individualisation was between 114,938 to 452,190 (3.34 to 14.33 per prescription); exclusive of the cost of testing. Majority of orally administered drugs have negligible cost impact, except for voriconazole which, despite only prescribed in 23 patients, has the highest cost impact. When using the highest cost per drug unit, there were significant increases in the cost impact for amitriptyline (from 138 to 45,653), fluorouracil (from 2234 to 47,027), irinotecan (from 29,205 to 129,916), and tamoxifen (from 1798 to 24,452). As the cost of ADR pharmacogenes panel-test remains unknown, this study predicted that the maximum cost of such test can vary between 14.06 to 55.33 per patient. To ensure dose individualisation remains costsaving, restricting testing to selected patient groups where the projected cost-savings are lower than the cost of test for 70% of patients is recommended. Limitation(s): This study assumed that dose individualisation was acted upon existing genetic findings. Study also assumed that dose individualisation results in total ADR avoidance. The cost saving from ADR avoidance is not included. Study only reviewed population prevalence data from Caucasian ethnicity. Conclusion(s): This study demonstrated that genetic-based dose individualisation can be cost-saving and have considerable cost impact for certain drugs. It also highlighted key factors to consider when prioritising drug-gene pairs for panel testing integration.

J3624,2022,Cardiac implantable electronic device infections: prognostic value of the PADIT score and its cost-utility implications for antimicrobial envelope use in the United Kingdom,"Background: The incidence of cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infections is rising. Purpose(s): We examined the factors associated with CIED infection, assessed the prognostic power of the PADIT risk score, and modelled the cost-utility of selective TYRX antimicrobial envelope use for preventing CIED infections. Method(s): Data were extracted from 2016 to 2019, and included all de novo implants, generator changes and lead interventions for transvenous CIEDs at a high-volume UK centre. CIED infection was defined as hospitalisation for device infection within 12 months of a procedure. Cost-utility analysis was informed by standardised tariffs, and quality adjusted life year (QALY) and efficacy data was extrapolated from analysis of the WRAP-IT trial. Result(s): 6,035 patients underwent 7,383 procedures; CIED infection occurred in 59 individuals (0.8%). In addition to the constituents of the PA- DIT score, lead extraction (HR 3.3 (1.9-6.1), p<0.0001), C-reactive protein >50mg/l (HR 3.0 (1.4-6.4), p=0.005), re-intervention within two years (HR 10.1 (5.6-17.9), p<0.0001), and procedure duration over two hours (HR 2.6 (1.6-4.1), p=0.001) were independent predictors of infection. Increased PADIT score was strongly associated with infection (AUC: 0.82, HR per point increase: 1.36 (1.27-1.47), p<0.0001). A cost-utility model assigning TYRX envelopes to patients with PADIT scores >=6 predicted a reduction in infections (number needed to treat: 72) and a cost per QALY gained within the UK's (NICE) cost-effectiveness threshold (25,107). Conclusion(s): The PADIT score was a powerful predictor of CIED infections in a heterogeneous population,and may facilitate cost-effective TYRX envelope allocation in selected high-risk patients.

J3630,2022,Probabilistic microsimulation to examine the cost-effectiveness of hospital admission screening strategies for carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in the United Kingdom,"Background: Antimicrobial resistance has been recognised as a global threat with carbapenemase- producing-Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) as a prime example. CPE has similarities to COVID-19 where asymptomatic patients may be colonised representing a source for onward transmission. There are limited treatment options for CPE infection leading to poor outcomes and increased costs. Admission screening can prevent cross-transmission by pre-emptively isolating colonised patients. Objective(s): We assess the relative cost-effectiveness of screening programmes compared with no- screening. Method(s): A microsimulation parameterised with NHS Scotland date was used to model scenarios of the prevalence of CPE colonised patients on admission. Screening strategies were (a) two-step screening involving a clinical risk assessment (CRA) checklist followed by microbiological testing of high-risk patients; and (b) universal screening. Strategies were considered with either culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. All costs were reported in 2019 UK pounds with a healthcare system perspective. Result(s): In the low prevalence scenario, no screening had the highest probability of cost-effectiveness. Among screening strategies, the two CRA screening options were the most likely to be cost-effective. Screening was more likely to be cost-effective than no screening in the prevalence of 1 CPE colonised in 500 admitted patients or more. There was substantial uncertainty with the probabilities rarely exceeding 40% and similar results between strategies. Screening reduced non-isolated bed-days and CPE colonisation. The cost of screening was low in relation to total costs. Conclusion(s): The specificity of the CRA checklist was the parameter with the highest impact on the cost-effectiveness. Further primary data collection is needed to build models with less uncertainty in the parameters.

J3638,2022,"Utility of PINP to monitor osteoporosis treatment in primary care, the POSE study (PINP and Osteoporosis in Sheffield Evaluation)","Purpose: In Sheffield (UK), we introduced the PINP monitoring algorithm for the management of osteoporosis treatment delivered in primary care. Our aims were to evaluate whether this algorithm was associated with better osteoporosis outcomes and was cost-effective compared to standard care. Method(s): Inclusion criteria were referral from Sheffield GPs, BMD scans performed between 2012 and 2013 and a report advising initiation of oral bisphosphonate and PINP monitoring. 906 patients were identified and retrospectively divided into Group A (intention to monitor, with baseline PINP, n = 588) and Group B (no intention to monitor, without baseline PINP, n = 318). The model described by Davis and colleagues was used to extrapolate life-time costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Result(s): No differences were found in baseline characteristics between groups (age, gender, BMI, BMD and major risk factors for fractures). More patients in Group A started oral treatment (77.4% vs 49.1%; p < 0.001), but there were no differences between groups in the presence of a gap in treatment >3 months or in treatment duration. Patients in Group A were more likely to have follow-up DXA scan at 4-6 years from baseline (46.9% vs 29.2%; p < 0.000) and had a greater increase in total hip BMD (+2.74% vs + 0.42%; p value = 0.003). Fewer new fractures occurred in Group A but this was not statistically significant, but the numbers of fractures were small. Patients in Group A were more likely to change management (p = 0.005) including switching to zoledronate (p = 0.03). The PINP measurement and increased prescribing in Group A resulted in increases in both costs (30.19) and QALYs (0.0039) relative to Group B, giving an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 7660 in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Conclusion(s): Patients monitored with PINP are more likely to start oral bisphosphonate treatment, switch to zoledronate, have follow-up DXA scans and a greater increase of hip BMD. PINP monitoring has the potential to be cost-effective in a UK NHS setting given that interventions with an ICER under 20,000 are generally considered to be cost-effective.
